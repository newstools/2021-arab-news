RIYADH: A team of doctors managed to extract a potentially dangerous bracelet from the stomach of a Saudi six-year-old child.
A team of medical specialists at King Abdulaziz Hospital in Jeddah conducted a two-and-a-half hour operation to save the child, who was admitted to hospital a few days earlier after suffering severe pain in his stomach.
X-ray scans of the child’s body showed a bracelet in his intestines, according to a report by Al Arabiya. 
The child’s condition is stable and improving, the report added.
