RIYADH: The Kempinski Floating Palace, a luxury hotel, plans to open in Dubai at the beginning of 2023, local media reported on Wednesday. The project worth 870 million dirhams ($236.9 million) has 156-rooms and a suite hotel. Anchored next to Jumeirah Beach Road, visitors can arrive by speedboat or directly with their own boats to the floating palace. Kempinski includes 12 other floating luxury villas, which are grouped with the possibility to sail to other anchorages, according to reports. “We are delighted to be able to offer our guests in Dubai such a first experience from 2023 onward,” Bernold Schroeder, CEO of Kempinski Group and chairman of Kempinski AG, was quoted as saying.
