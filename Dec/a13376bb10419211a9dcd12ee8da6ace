EILAT, Israel: Women from 80 countries vied for the Miss Universe crown in the Israeli city of Eilat on Sunday. The 70th edition of the annual pageant, being held in Israel for the first time, has also faced complications from the coronavirus pandemic. Among those challenging for top prize are Miss Morocco Kawtar Benhalima and Miss Bahrain Manar Nadeem Deyani, whose majority Muslim nations normalized ties with Israel last year. South Africa's Ministry of Sports, Culture and Arts had urged its contestant to stay away from Eilat, citing "atrocities committed by Israel against Palestinians." The call echoed Palestinian groups who pleaded with contestants to avoid the event. Despite those calls, Miss South Africa Lalela Mswane was in the Red Sea resort city, where the final competition gets underway overnight before the 2021 winner is named at roughly 0300 GMT Monday. In an interview with AFP in Jerusalem late last month, reigning Miss Universe Andrea Meza, of Mexico, said the pageant should steer clear of politics. "Miss Universe isn't a political movement, nor a religious one. It's about women and what they can offer." Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia, nations that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel, have not sent contestants but both cited complications related to the pandemic, not Israel's rights record. The UAE, which also normalised ties with Israel last year and where Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was to make a historic visit Sunday, has also not sent a candidate. But the UAE said that was "due to time constraints," in selecting its national winner.
