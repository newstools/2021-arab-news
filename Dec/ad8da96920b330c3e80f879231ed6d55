DUBAI: Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Societe Generale SA are changing to a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the New Year in the UAE, which is aligning its working week with most global markets. The German bank will from Jan. 3 operate Monday-Friday instead of the current Sunday-Thursday as is common around the Middle East, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Wall Street-based JPMorgan is also adapting the same week in UAE along with flexible practices such as a break for Muslim prayers on Fridays, the bank said in a statement. France-based Societe Generale's spokesperson said it is implementing Saturday-Sunday weekend from Jan. 2 in its Dubai and Abu Dhabi entities, according to an emailed statement. Representatives of Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The banks' move comes after the UAE said on Dec. 7 that it would shift to a four-and-a-half day week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the start of next year. Private companies are, however, free to choose their own working week.
