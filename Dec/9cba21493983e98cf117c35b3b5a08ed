RIYADH: The Arab coalition destroyed a drone targeting southern Saudi Arabia on Monday, according to Al-Ekhbariya TV. Launched from Sanaa International Airport, the drone was aimed at civilians in Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah Airport in Jizan area, the coalition said. Meanwhile, Coalition air strikes had hit parts of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, which are controlled by the Houthi militia. According to the Arab coalition’s earlier reports, military operations were carried out in Sanaa to destroy workshops and warehouses containing drones and weapons. They also advised civilians to avoid the area before the operation began.
