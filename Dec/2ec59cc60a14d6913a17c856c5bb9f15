RIYADH: Jeddah Eagles have edged closer to winning the Western division of Saudi Arabia’s new women’s Regional Football League after beating Fire Ball Academy 7-0 in the ninth of 10 rounds of matches. The team’s goals came through braces scored by Asrar Mohammed and Bireen Sadaqa, and a strike each from Lama Abdel Aal, Bayan Sadaqa, and Hala Khashoggi. The round also saw the Storm defeat White Lion 3-1, thanks to two goals by Shahd Damas and one by Raghad Mukhaizin, while Tahani Al-Zahrani netted for the visitors. The final match in the ninth round of the Western division — which will wrap up on Monday — ended in a 1-1 draw between Miraas and United Power. The Regional Football League, organized by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, kicked off last month with 16 teams taking part in the first phase. Games have mostly been played in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The league is split into three regions with six teams each in the Central and Western regions, and a four-team Eastern region. Matches are played in a round-robin, home-and-away format, with the winner of each group declared champion of their region. The top three teams in the Central and Western regions, as well as the top two from the Eastern region, will progress to the national championships, which will be played at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah from Jan. 1. The Central division was earlier this week won by Al-Yamamah and will conclude with its 10th round of matches on Friday.
