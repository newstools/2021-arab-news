LONDON: Jordan on Thursday suspended the screening of Amira film by Egyptian director Mohamed Diab following heavy criticisms that the film 'insults Palestinian prisoners.' The Royal Film Commission of Jordan, the official submitting organization to the Academy Awards, has also decided to withdraw the film Amira for consideration to the 2022 Oscar’s race. Earlier on Thursday, Palestinian activists launched an online campaign calling for the boycott of a film titled Amira, selected as the Jordanian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards for mocking Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Using the hashtag #Pull_Out_Amira and Palestinian and pro-Palestine advocates have called on supporters to boycott the film, arguing that it whitewashes Israeli crimes. Amira, Arabic for princess, follows the life of a 17-year-old Palestinian, who was conceived with the smuggled sperm of her father who is serving a life sentence in an Israeli jail. After her father fails to conceive another child, it is discovered that he is infertile and that Amira’s biological father is actually an Israeli officer. Critics have argued that this feeds into Israel’s narrative and discounts the suffering of Palestinians and their struggles. Arab News tried to get in touch with Amira's press office, but they did not immedaitely respond to a request for comment.
