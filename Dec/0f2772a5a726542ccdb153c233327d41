RIYADH: The Arab coalition said the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen attempted to target Saudi Arabia’s southwestern region on Tuesday evening, state TV reported. The coalition said an “enemy projectile” fell near one of the public roads and traditional markets in Jazan. “The Houthi attempt this evening to target civilians in a deliberate and systematic manner is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” it added. Early on Wednesday, the Saudi Ministry of Defense said they had destroyed an airborne object targeting western Saudi Arabia, after the coalition announced the destruction of a hostile drone in Yemeni territory. The Houthis have launched numerous drones and ballistic missiles targeting the Kingdom’s southern region since Sunday and on Monday targeted the capital, Riyadh, with ballistic missiles, all of which were intercepted and destroyed by Saudi air defenses. Shrapnel from one of the missiles landed in some neighborhoods in Riyadh, without causing any damage. The attacks have been strongly condemned by the international community.
