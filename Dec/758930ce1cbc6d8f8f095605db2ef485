HADRAMOUT: Hundreds of Yemenis have benefitted from a Saudi-backed vocational and business skills training and support scheme being run in the war-torn country. In partnership with the UN Development Program and the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center continues to implement the project in Yemen. A total of 500 people, 326 of them women, were successfully trained in Lahij and Hadramout on developing their entrepreneurial skills, including project planning, time management, market analysis, customer service, and finance. The Kingdom has been the leading donor of humanitarian assistance to Yemen for six years and the $3 million project aims to improve the livelihoods of Yemenis while offering grants to help those looking to start their own business. The initiative provides support and training in areas including entrepreneurship, agribusiness, food processing, textiles, and handloom, and technical skills such as carpentry, vehicle maintenance, mobile phones, and other electronic devices.
