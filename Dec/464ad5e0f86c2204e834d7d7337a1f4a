RIYADH: Saudi and Bahraini companies took part in a forum on Thursday on the sidelines of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Bahrain.
The forum discussed opportunities for economic integration by strengthening joint cooperation in various fields, and opening new and diverse horizons to support trade, investment and tourism.
It also considered partnerships in industry and energy, the role of trade agreements in promoting economic integration, and opportunities for integration in the real estate sector.
