JEDDAH: Jeddah is hosting the finals of the FIBA 3x3 World Tour Final 2021 for the second year running in King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) on Dec. 17-18. The 10th World Tour Final — which will include 12 of the world’s best basketball teams — is organized by the Ministry of Sports in coordination with the Saudi Basketball Federation and will be contested under the supervision of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). The teams taking part in the event are Riga (Lativia), Ub (Serbia), Liman (Serbia), Amsterdam Talent & Pro (Netherlands), Antwerp (Belgium), San Juan PCI Group (Puerto Rico), Jeddah (KSA), Sakiai Gulbele (Lithuania), Gagarin (Russia), Princeton (USA), Graz (Austria), and Lausanne Sport (Switzerland). While Antwerp and Graz will make their debuts in Jeddah, this is the first time since 2012 that the four-time winners Novi Sad of Serbia will not compete in the World Tour Final, and the first time since 2013 that Piran (Slovenia) won't take part either. In fact, it will mark the first time in World Tour history that no Slovenian team has played in the final. The Jeddah team will be represented by members Raad Barnawi, Kevin Corre, Nemanja Draskpvic and Ovidijus Varanauskas. “We are very delighted to host this global event for the second time and we are ready to host the best teams in the world,” said Dr. Ghassan Tashkandi, the President of the Saudi Basketball Federation. The tournament will also witness many entertainment side events, after they was absent from the last year’s edition due to precautionary measures in addressing the pandemic.
