CAIRO: Egyptian citizens who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will from Wednesday be denied access to all government services and buildings unless they can provide evidence of a negative PCR test. The decision was taken by the Supreme Committee for Coronavirus Crisis Management, which said the rule would apply to the provision of government services in all governorates and ministries. The Ministry of Local Development instructed governors to implement the committee’s decision and refuse entry to government departments for anyone who is unable to provide evidence that they have been fully vaccinated or submit a negative PCR test result. The move is the latest in a slew of preventive measures introduced by Egypt to contain the spread of COVID-19 in places of work and study. The Ministry of Health and Population said it had made vaccines available to all citizens and that they should get vaccinated to avoid being disadvantaged by the new ruling. It added that people who had not yet had their jabs should visit one of the many vaccination facilities located at medical centers, subway and railway stations, or the mobile units that travel throughout villages and towns. Once vaccinated, citizens will be able to get a vaccination certificate that will allow them to enter government facilities, the health ministry said. Egypt implemented a rule on Nov. 15 that prevents unvaccinated government employees from entering their place of work.
