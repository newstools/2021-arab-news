RIYADH: The Arab coalition said on Thursday that it had destroyed an explosives-laden Houthi boat. The boat, launched from Yemen's Hodeidah, was destroyed before it could be used to carry out an attack in the southern Red Sea, the coalition added. The coalition also gave the militia a six-hour deadline to remove weapons from Al-Thawra Sports City Stadium in Sanaa starting at 8pm local time. It said that immunity would be lifted off the stadium if the Houthis did not comply with international humanitarian law. Earlier on Thursday, the coalition destroyed a Houthi drone targeting Abha International Airport. Shrapnel was scattered around the airport as a result but no casualties were reported. The Houthi militia frequently launches cross-border attacks targeting civilians.
