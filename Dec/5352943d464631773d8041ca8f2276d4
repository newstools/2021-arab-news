ROME: Italy’s prime minster has promised to do all he can to support the democratic process in Libya following the postponement of presidential elections in the African nation. “Italy and Europe have done everything possible so far and will continue to do everything they can to favor the process toward democracy in Libya,” Mario Draghi told a news conference attended by Arab News. He said the postponement of the elections was “due to complications caused by a situation that remains fragmented between the various centers of power” in Libya. “We hope that the dialogue between the parties involved will resume soon so that a new date for the elections can be set after the constitutional context in which they have to be held is clarified,” he added. Draghi also praised the UN for its role in helping Libya to manage the flow of migrants trying to reach the Mediterranean. “We need determined action in the creation of humanitarian corridors and assisted returns,” he said. Meanwhile, Italian President Sergio Mattarella said in his Christmas greeting to army units deployed overseas that Libya, which hosts 300 Italian soldiers, is “particularly important.” He added: “The stabilization of that country is important for us and for the whole area of the Mediterranean. The Italian mission is a sign of friendship and aims to support the local population.”
