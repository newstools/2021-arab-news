MUSCAT: Oman is banning weddings and funerals in mosques, halls and other public places as part of continuing coronavirus safety protocols, state news agency ONA reported. 
The decision comes after members of the country’s Supreme Committee, which is in charge of tackling developments delated to COVID-19, studied reports related to the coronavirus pandemic, with an in-depth focus on the omicron mutation.
Authorities clarified that the latest decision was also prompted by people’s non-abidance to previous directives and measures regarding social events. These included having taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, wearing face masks, maintaining an appropriate social distance with other attendees and limiting the capacity to 50 percent. 
Oman’s COVID-19 Supreme Committee said the new decision will remain in place until further notice.
