DUBAI: Vaccinated motorists entering Abu Dhabi will be required to show a green status on their Al-Hosn apps from Thursday, Dec. 30, as the emirate again tightened its COVID-19 protocols.
Unvaccinated travelers meanwhile need to present a negative PCR test result received within 96 hours in order to be granted entry, the Abu Dhabi Media Office announced on Twitter on Tuesday.
They also clarified in a follow-up statement that the new protocols will be in addition to the current procedures, which entail using EDE scanners to rapidly detect potential coronavirus cases. 
“The new entry requirements are in line with efforts to continue enhancing precautionary measures to protect public health,” wrote Abu Dhabi Media Office.
COVID-19 cases have sharply risen in the UAE during the past weeks, with 1,846 infections reported on Tuesday, from less than 50 cases reported in early December.
