SAKAKA: Jouf Governor Prince Faisal bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz met with Minister of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Asheikh on Thursday. The two men discussed the construction, maintenance and restoration of mosques — as well as the need for qualified imams, preachers and muezzins — in the province. Prince Faisal praised the ministry’s ongoing efforts to promote balance and moderation as a way of tackling extremist ideologies, and noted the role the ministry has played in the progress that has been achieved Kingdom-wide in female empowerment by employing a number of women in its branches, including in Jouf. Following the meeting, the two men witnessed the signing of an agreement between the ministry’s branch in the province and the Jouf Association for Renewable Energy, of which Prince Faisal is honorary president. The agreement aims to support and promote Jouf as a renewable energy hub. It sets out plans for a transition to renewable energy in the province’s mosques and ministry buildings and also encourages anyone building a mosque to use solar power as an energy source for lighting and air conditioning.
