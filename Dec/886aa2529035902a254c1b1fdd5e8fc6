JEDDAH: The US mission to Saudi Arabia, in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the scholarship departments of the Ministry of Culture, the Royal Commission for AlUla, and NEOM, held a virtual event recently to announce the “Quincy Student Mobility Initiative.” The new initiative is a combination of the US mission’s programs aimed at helping qualified and motivated Saudi young leaders to achieve their higher education goals at American colleges and universities. Each of the four Quincy Initiative programs supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals “in a different way.” The discussion theme of “International Education for the Vision 2030 Generation,” prompted both US and Saudi officials to address how the Kingdom’s new scholarship programs are supporting Vision 2030, and the role of US higher education in helping to meet those goals. Denison Offutt, deputy chief of the mission, said that “each year, tens of thousands of Saudi students choose to pursue higher education in the US because the US higher education sector offers world-class faculty and research facilities, and degrees across all fields of study. With the ‘Quincy Student Mobility Initiative,’ we are making study in the US even more accessible to Saudi students.”
