LONDON: Britain has granted another 23 licenses to French fishermen, a government spokesperson said Saturday, a day after a deadline set by Paris to resolve a post-Brexit battle over fishing rights. The EU had set London a December 10 deadline to grant licenses to dozens of French fishing boats under a Brexit deal signed last year, with Paris threatening European legal action if no breakthrough emerged. The licenses were agreed Friday night after British officials met EU counterparts and followed what the spokesman called an “evidence-based approach” ensuring vessels qualify to work in UK waters. The spokesperson added that the approach “provides stability and ensures the sustainability of our fisheries,” with the UK granting 18 licenses and the Channel Island of Jersey five.
