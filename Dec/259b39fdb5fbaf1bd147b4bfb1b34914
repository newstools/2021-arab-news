RIYADH: The Ministry of Culture announced the launch of the Intangible Cultural Heritage initiative, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education. The national initiative aims to educate students on the intangible heritage of the Kingdom in order to preserve it, by encouraging them to carry out office and field research. The ministry divided the initiative’s timeline into six temporal phases: launching the initiative; introducing and sensitizing students to the importance of heritage and the necessity of documenting it; receiving and sorting out participants and forming teams; implementing workshops; receiving and assessing students’ preliminary research by supervisors and experts; and carrying out explorative field trips and developing research. The initiative will conclude its work on May 25, 2022, when the works achieving the initiative’s goals will be honored. The courses covered by the initiative’s framework are traditional performing arts, stories, proverbs, folk songs, games, crafts, and food. Participation in the initiative is open to middle and high school students across the Kingdom, who will be provided with the support necessary to carry out their research according to sound methodological bases. The ministry will work on achieving this goal with the participation of teachers and activity leaders in public schools. Through this initiative, the ministry aims to develop students’ research capacities, equip them with the basic skills related to the documentation of intangible cultural heritage and obtain findings to document this heritage in all its forms, which will contribute to its preservation.
