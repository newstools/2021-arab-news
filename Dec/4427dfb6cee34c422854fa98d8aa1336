CAIRO: Egypt ranked first in Africa and 53rd globally out of 154 countries in the Global Knowledge Index, jumping 19 places compared to last year when it came in at 72nd. The index measures global knowledge as a comprehensive concept closely related to sustainable development and the various dimensions of contemporary human life. It comes under the umbrella of the joint initiative, known as the “Knowledge Project,” between the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Knowledge Foundation and the UN Development Program. Egyptian Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research Khaled Abdel Ghaffar remarked that Egypt’s progress in the index reflects the development of higher education, scientific research and innovation in the country.
