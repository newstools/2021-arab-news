NICOSIA: Jordan’s King Abdullah II paid an official visit to Cyprus on Friday for talks with President Nicos Anastasiades, during which several bilateral accords were signed, officials said.
The agreements covered issues including double taxation and the extradition of fugitives.
Following a military guard of honor, Anastasiades and Abdullah held a private meeting and exchanged gifts.
“President Anastasiades bestowed upon the king of Jordan the highest honor of the Republic of Cyprus... and King Abdullah II bestowed upon the president the highest honor of Jordan,” the presidency said.
The two leaders discussed bilateral relations and regional developments, as well as climate change and efforts to combat Covid-19.
Abdullah was also briefed on efforts to resume United Nations-backed Cyprus reunification talks and Turkish warnings against Nicosia over oil and gas exploration in the region.
Jordan has joined a burgeoning regional alliance that includes Egypt, Greece and Israel, based on shared energy interests.
