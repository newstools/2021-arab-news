RIYADH: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey will work to enhance its relations with Saudi Arabia, Al Arabiya reported. In May, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan received his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in Makkah. They agreed to “work on positive issues on our common agenda and to hold regular consultations,” Cavusoglu said, adding: “Our close cooperation will contribute to stability, peace and prosperity in the region.” The president’s remarks were made on Tuesday during an interview on state-owned news channel TRT World. Commenting on recent improvement in Turkish-UAE relations, Erdogan said: “The step we took with the UAE is important and historic, and I will visit the UAE in February.” Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed visited Ankara last week in his first official trip to Turkey since 2012. The UAE announced a $10 billion fund for investments in Turkey, after the crown prince held talks with the Turkish president. Erdogan also said in the interview: “We will witness developments with Egypt in the near future.”
