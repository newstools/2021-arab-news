RIYADH: The second International Date Fair was launched today at the Riyadh International Convention and Exhibition Centre, with the participation of Saudi producers and others involved in the date industry, under the supervision of the National Centre for Palms and Dates. Dates are one of the most important cultural foods in the Arabian Peninsula, and have always been an important source of nutrition on the breakfast table in the region. Nowadays, people around the world can enjoy them as Saudi Arabia exports dates to 107 international destinations. The five-day fair, which includes workshops, presentations, and educational events, aims to improve agricultural and industrial practices to raise efficiency and boost profits. It also looks to support small and medium businesses and open up new marketing opportunities. The Kingdom has more than 33 million palm trees, more than 123,000 agricultural holdings and 157 date factories, which also make products for the medical, cosmetic and building materials industries. The value of Saudi date exports grew by 7.1 percent in 2021, to reach a value of SR927 million ($247 million), while shipments by weight rose to 215,00 tons, a rise of 17 percent.
