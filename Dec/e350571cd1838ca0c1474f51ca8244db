DUBAI: Bahrain has announced the precautionary adoption of the coronavirus Yellow Alert Level starting Dec. 19 until Jan. 31 of 2022, state news agency BNA reported.
A Yellow Alert Level is declared if the rolling average of positive cases within intensive care units is 51 to 100 cases for seven days.
The National Medical Taskforce for Combatting the Coronavirus said the decision has been taken in line with Bahrain’s approach of prioritising public health.
It added that this decision is subject to review.
The Taskforce also called on people to take their booster shots at the health centers across the Kingdom, without the need to make an appointment. Under the Yellow Alert Level, only vaccinated green shield holders in the country would have access to public places such as shopping malls, restaurants and cafes, barber shops as well as indoor gyms and sports halls, among others.
Eligible individuals who have already received their booster shot can follow the procedures of the Green Alert Level,  it said.
