RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in Oman on Monday on the first leg of multiple stops in his tour of Gulf states. Prince Mohammed’s visit comes “based on directives from King Salman, his keenness to communicate with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and to strengthen ties,” the Royal Court said in a statement issued by Saudi Press Agency. During his meeting with Haitham bin Tarik, Sultan of Oman, the prince will review several issues of mutual concern, with the aim of achieving progress and prosperity for both countries and both peoples, Oman News Agency reported. During his tour, the crown prince will also meet with leaders and senior officials of the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, to discuss bilateral relations. The visit to Oman is an “affirmation of the ties of fraternity and kinship, and the historical relations binding the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” ONA said, adding both countries “are set for a new stage of economic and investment cooperation in all fields.” Last July, the two countries reaffirmed plans to engage in joint investment in advanced technologies, innovation, renewable energy projects, industry health, real estate, tourism, petrochemical converting industries, supply chains, logistics partnership, information technology and financial technology, the ONA report said. “The achievements made over the past five months and the active exchange of visits among officials reflect the keen desire of the two countries to work together.” This includes establishing the Saudi-Omani Investment Forum that was held in Muscat in August, where a number of agreements and memoranda of understanding were signed.
