ABU DHABI: Ons Jabeur made history in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, becoming the first Arab to play at, and win, the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, at the International Tennis Center, part of Zayed Sports City. The Tunisian faced Tokyo Olympics gold medal winner Belinda Bencic in the headline women’s match and came from a set down to claim a memorable 4-6, 6-3, (10-8) victory, to the delight of the crowd. Swiss player Bencic looked in good touch early in the match, taking the first set 6-4. But Jabeur, who reached a career high No. 7 earlier this season, showed great desire to get back into the match, targeting Bencic’s backhand and racing into a 5-0 lead in set two. Bencic, though, showed why she is an Olympic champion, fighting back to claim the next three games. But Jabeur refused to be denied, and immediately broke her opponent’s serve to level the match at 1-1 and head into a deciding super tiebreak. Both players showed great determination to secure the victory. Jabeur, on match point at 9-6, attempted a drop shot for victory, which had Bencic racing from the back of the court to crash a powerful cross-court winner to great applause. The history-making Jabeur stood firm to wrap up the super tiebreak 10-8 for a memorable victory and was delighted with her performance. “It feels amazing. Belinda plays tough and surprised me with her drop shots, so it was great to get through it. It was always a dream to play her in an Arab country to represent Tunisia and the Arab world. A real privilege. And to pick up the victory is great,” the 27-year-old African No. 1 said. “I want to keep breaking records, continuing my journey, and proving I’m deserving of a place in the top 10. I’m surprised at the reaction I’ve been receiving, hopefully what I’m doing can do something to help bring more Arab players into the game,” she added.
