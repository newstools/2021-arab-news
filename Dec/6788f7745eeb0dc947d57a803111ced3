AL-AHSA: The US Consul General in Dhahran David Edginton recently visited Al-Ahsa’s Gov. Prince Badr bin Mohammed and exchanged views on bilateral cooperation, praising the development works done in the province. Prince Badr, who received the consul general and his accompanying delegation, hailed the strong and historic relation between the US and the Kingdom, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Edginton expressed admiration for the great development witnessed in the province in various fields including the tourism sector. With its deep-rooted heritage and culture and the largest date palm oasis in the world, Al-Ahsa is one of the Eastern Province’s top tourist sites to visit. Its name was inspired by the palm trees, the shade they give, and the dates they bear. For years, the area’s greenery has prevailed over the nearby desert, giving it a unique appeal. The Kingdom and the US have long shared a strategic alliance, dating back to 1945 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with the founder of Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while welcoming Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan to Washington in October this year, said: “We have a strong partnership between the US and Saudi Arabia. We are committed to the defense of the Kingdom.” He added: “This partnership with Saudi Arabia is an important one, a vital one, and in terms of dealing with some of the most significant challenges we face, one that we are very appreciative of.” Prince Faisal has also praised the strong partnership between the two allies, saying: “Our relationship has delivered immense value for both of our countries, but not just for us, also for the region, and for the world.”
