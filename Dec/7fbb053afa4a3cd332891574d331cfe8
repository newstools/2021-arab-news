DUBAI: Moonbug Entertainment Ltd. and Orbit Showtime Network have announced a partnership, which will see the launch of the first Moonbug Kids linear channel in the Middle East and North Africa region. Launching on Dec. 12, the new channel will bring Moonbug’s full collection of kids’ entertainment and educational programs to families in the region for the first time. The slate of shows that will be aired includes “Cocomelon,” “Blippi,” “Morphle,” and “Little Baby Bum,” among others. The linear channel will provide over 175 hours of content with a supporting content package available on the OSN Streaming app. All content on the streaming app will be available in English and dubbed in Arabic and French. “We are excited to be the exclusive home to the first-ever Moonbug Kids linear channel in MENA. It will be a safe, curated but most importantly, an entertaining place for kids, especially preschoolers,” said Nick Forward, chief digital and content officer at OSN. The partnership with OSN is in line with Moonbug’s global expansion plans. Earlier this year, the kids’ entertainment company partnered with television network Cignal to launch a dedicated Moonbug Kids channel in the Philippines. The company said in a statement that there would be more launches from single show packages on third-party outlets to branded channel blocks as well as 24/7 linear channels. “Launching a new linear channel in this region forms a key part of our mission at Moonbug, to create and distribute inspiring and engaging stories to expand kids’ worlds and minds,” said Nicolas Eglau, managing director for the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific regions at Moonbug.
