She cannot afford a doctor. She goes the traditional way to abort the baby using cinnamon. It’s an observation of a mother-daughter relationship,” she added. “Becoming” was made in 2020 over a six-month period, but was delayed being shown because of the pandemic, she said. “For ‘Becoming’ we all worked really independently. But for ‘Quareer,’ we had a much stronger collaboration,” she added of a separate omnibus project that is set to screen at the upcoming Red Sea International Film Festival.
