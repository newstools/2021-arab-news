The UN said the agreement on Nov. 21 was an initial step forward toward fully restoring constitutional order and civilian democratic rule. 
More work remains to be done and urgent and serious steps by the authorities are needed to reaffirm commitment to the constitutional declaration ...and pave the way toward free and fair elections leading to civilian democratic order, said the UN spokesperson.
“To begin to gain domestic and international acceptance, authorities must urgently release all those who have been arbitrarily detained since Oct. 25. Full accountability for HR violations, including the killing and injuring of protesters during recent protests must also be ensured,” said Stephane Dujarric.
“The path of the transition cannot be decided without engagement of all parties involved in Sudan revolution. We support PM Hamdok’s efforts to engage with the forces of Freedom and Change, resistance committees, and other voices among Sudanese public.
