The US Department of Energy has guaranteed a $1 billion conditional loan for a Nebraska based hydrogen project. The loan is the first of its kind to go to a non-nuclear project since 2016, Bloomberg reported. It will convert natural gas into hydrogen that is to be mainly dispensed to the agriculture sector. In addition, any black carbon generated on site will automatically be used in tires and for plastic production. The loan signifies the reinforcement of the department, which plans to use over $40 billion in loan authority to pave the way for clean-energy technologies.
