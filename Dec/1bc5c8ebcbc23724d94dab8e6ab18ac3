TABUK: The 40-year-old Greek cargo ship Georgios G. has become one of the main tourist attractions in the northwest of Saudi Arabia in Tabuk, 55 km south of Haql governorate.
The ship was built in Britain with a length of 71.6m, a width of 11m, and a height of 4.9m. In 1978, the ship sailed from one of the Greek ports towards the Jordanian port of Aqaba and loaded with foodstuffs.
While passing through international waters, it drifted from its course eastward towards the territorial waters of Saudi Arabia and hit the coral reefs close to the Bi’r Al-Mashi beach, which created a hole in its body.
This incident flooded its front section, increasing its load and causing difficulty in the ship’s movement.
The ship has stood still ever since, with two-thirds of it being covered in water. Its front is on the coast tilted towards the sea, giving us a hint of last difficult night that the ship, its captain, and its crew went through.
