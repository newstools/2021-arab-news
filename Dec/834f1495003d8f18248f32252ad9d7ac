CAIRO: EgyptAir has announced that it will resume flights to South Africa from Dec. 16. It said there will be one flight between Cairo and Johannesburg every Thursday, and preventive measures announced by Egypt’s Health Ministry will be applied to passengers coming from South Africa. On Nov. 26, Egypt decided to stop direct flights to and from South Africa due to concerns over the new omicron variant of COVID-19. The ministry’s spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar said the variant has not yet reached Egypt, and there are measures in place to confront it. The World Health Organization on Wednesday said omicron has been detected in 57 countries.
