SAKAKA: Nestled atop a mountain in the city of Sakaka in northwestern Saudi Arabia, Zaabal Castle is more than just a centuries-old structure. Its mud and stone-built walls tell tales of the past.
The castle contains four watchtowers and a water reservoir. The castle itself is believed to have been built about 200 years ago, but some of the structures that can be seen on the site have been there since the first century A.D.
The courtyard collected water that was then transferred into the wells in the city. The wells that are found there are large enough for people to be able to walk through them. However, for the safety of tourists, they remain sealed.
Aside from being an archaeological marvel, the fort sits on the highest point in the area, offering panoramic views of the city.
