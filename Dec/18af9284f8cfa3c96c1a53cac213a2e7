CAIRO: Egypt will launch its first fleet of buses powered by natural gas next year, Minister of Public Enterprise Hisham Tawfik has said. About 70 percent of the components used in the manufacturing of the buses will be sourced locally, in cooperation with several Egyptian companies, he said. Tawfiq said that the fleet will include buses that can accommodate 14 to 50 passengers, and that the goal of the project is to localize technology and transport production. “Our strategy is to work in the production of environmentally friendly vehicles, whether they run on natural gas or electricity,” he added. A delegation from the Belarusian Minsk Automobile Plant signed a contract to supply production materials for the project. Production is expected to begin in mid-2022, with a target of 250 buses completed per year. Tawfiq welcomed cooperation with the Belarusian side, especially in light of the distinguished relations between the two countries, which have developed significantly in recent years.
