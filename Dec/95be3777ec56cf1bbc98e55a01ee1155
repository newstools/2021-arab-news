Also on Wednesday, KSrelief signed an agreement to equip and operate Hajjah’s Emergency Center for Epidemic Disease Control in its third phase. Ahmed bin Ali Al-Baiz, KSrelief assistant supervisor general for operations and programs, signed the agreement at the center’s headquarters in Riyadh. Dr. Abdullah Al-Wadei, deputy director of the health and environmental aid department at KSrelief, said that the project aims to fight diseases and epidemics, secure primary healthcare in the Hiran area of Hajjah province and provide statistical data to the epidemiological surveillance system database. Al-Wadei added that the agreement will equip and operate the emergency center, and secure medicines, supplies and laboratory solutions. The center will also be funded to provide diagnostic, treatment and isolation services for cases of epidemic diseases. It will combat epidemics by carrying out insecticide fogging protocols, distributing nets, safely disposing of medical waste, and hosting health education and awareness events. The project is expected to benefit 62,000 people and is part of the Kingdom’s efforts to support vital sectors in Yemen.
