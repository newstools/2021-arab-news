RIYADH: Saudi Arabia called on the UN Security Council to hold the Houthi militia and those who supply it with arms and resources accountable in a bid to stop the militia threatening international peace and security. The request was made by the Kingdom’s permanent representative to the UN Abdallah Al-Mouallimi in a letter to the organization’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council. “I write about the continuation of terrorist attacks launched by the Iranian-backed terrorist Houthi militia on civilians and civilian objects in Saudi Arabia. This includes a military projectile hitting a shop in Samtah, Jazan on Dec. 24 which resulted in the deaths of a Saudi citizen and a Yemeni resident. Seven civilians including six citizens and a Bangladeshi resident were also injured and two shops and 12 vehicles were damaged,” the letter said. Al-Mouallimi stressed that targeting civilians and civilian objects is a war crime, and that the Houthi militia must be held accountable in accordance with international law. He said the Kingdom will spare no effort to take all necessary measures to protect its territory and preserve the safety of its citizens and residents in accordance with international laws. “It is clear that the absence of strict measures by the international community, especially the Security Council, toward those who supply weapons to the Houthi militia, will allow the militia to continue its terrorist acts in the region,” the envoy said. “It is therefore of paramount importance that the Security Council assume its responsibility towards the Houthis and those who supply their arms and the resources that finance their terrorist acts, in order to stop their threats to international peace and security.”
