LONDON: Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, has canceled all flights to Morocco until February 2022. The move follows a total ban by the Moroccan government on flights arriving in the North African country until Dec. 13 to combat the spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19. It is not yet clear whether the ban will extend beyond the initial December deadline. Other countries, including Japan and Israel, have also implemented stringent flight bans in an attempt to prevent the spread of the new variant. Irish carrier Ryanair usually flies thousands of flights a day across Europe and beyond. The continent’s COVID-19 outbreak is far worse than many other places in the world, including Morocco, which recorded just 90 cases in the last 24 hours compared with 50,000 in Britain.
