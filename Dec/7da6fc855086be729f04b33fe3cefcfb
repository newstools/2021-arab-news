RIYADH: A Saudi citizen and a Yemeni resident of the Kingdom were killed after a Houthi projectile hit Jazan on Friday. The projectile fell in Samtah, a town in Jazan, and also damaged an industrial workshop, the Arab coalition said. Earlier, a projectile hit a village neighbouring Najran and damaged a vehicle belonging to a civilian. The coalition said the projectiles were launched from the Yemeni city of Saada and that it was carrying out airstrikes in response to deal with the source of the threat. It later said that four depots used to store ballistic missiles and drones in Yemen’s Al-Mahwit governorate have been destroyed. Two mountain caves used to store ballistic missiles and weapons in Saada were also destroyed, the coalition said. The Houthi militia frequently carries out cross-border attacks which have been condemned by the international community.
