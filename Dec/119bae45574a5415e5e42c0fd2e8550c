RIYADH: British driver Sam Bird, winner of last year’s edition of Formula E’s Diriyah E-Prix, passed on inspirational advice to the star racers of the future during a visit to the Doos karting circuit in the Saudi capital. Bird was victorious in last season’s race at Diriyah Circuit and has been back in Saudi Arabia ahead of the start of 2022 ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, which gets underway in Riyadh in January. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver met a group of emerging motorsports talents in the Kingdom in the presence of officials from the Ministry of Sports and Formula E’s co-founder and Chief Championship Officer Alberto Longo. Bird spent time watching youngsters out on the track, before answering questions and offering advice to the aspiring drivers. “Karting was a key part of my early years of racing, and to see some of Saudi Arabia’s youngsters and their passion was great,” he said. “Hopefully, in the years to come, we will see more Saudi drivers on motorsport grids around the world. Diriyah holds fond memories for me not least because of winning my first race for Jaguar TCS Racing last year and I’m looking forward to returning in January 2022 for the first race of the new ABB Formula E season.” The Ministry of Sport and official event promoter CBX announced that tickets are on general sale for the Diriyah E-Prix, the first two races in the new season of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship on Jan. 28-29, 2022.
