JERUSALEM: A Palestinian who tried to ram Israeli soldiers with his car in the Israeli-occupied West Bank late Tuesday was shot dead by the soldiers, the army and Palestinian sources said.
The man crashed his car into a military jeep after being shot, causing both vehicles to burst into flames, a statement from the military said of the incident near the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
The Palestinian health ministry later announced the death of a “citizen.”
The army said “a terrorist accelerated his car toward a manned military post adjacent to the community of Mevo Dotan” in the West Bank.
“IDF troops who were at the point operated to stop the assailant by firing toward the vehicle,” the statement said.
“The vehicle crashed into a military vehicle that was in close proximity to the post. As a result, the vehicles caught on fire,” it added.
An army spokesman told AFP the military believed the assailant had died as a result of gunshot wounds, but was unable to confirm this.
