RIYADH: Emerging-markets bonds were the best performing globally in the year 2021 despite the central banks' stimulus withdrawal. Government bonds issued by South Africa, China, Indonesia, India and Croatia were the top among the world’s 46 markets, providing the largest annual jump in US Treasury yields since 2013, Bloomberg reported. The five countries’ high returns would ensure investors that the Federal Reserve would rest asset purchases and raise interest rates, without prompting global volatility.
