CAIRO: The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has described the Houthi militia’s continued targeting of Saudi territory from Yemen as “cowardly terrorist” attacks. The latest targets were the cities of Jazan, in the southwest of the Kingdom, which suffered some material losses, and nearby Abha. Two ballistic missiles aimed at Abha were intercepted and destroyed. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement early on Thursday that “the repeated targeting of civilian facilities and innocent civilians by the Houthi militia is a threat to the security and stability of Saudi Arabia, as well as a flagrant violation of the rules of international law.” The statement continued, “Egypt once again expresses its full solidarity with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the measures it is taking to confront these despicable terrorist attacks and stresses the close link between the security and stability of the two brotherly countries.” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry will hold talks on Thursday with Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is visiting Cairo. During the meeting, which is being held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two will discuss ways to enhance Egyptian-Saudi relations in various fields, as well as regional and international issues of common concern. The two ministers are scheduled to hold a joint press conference at the conclusion of the talks.
