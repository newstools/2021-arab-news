LONDON: A photo of Britain’s Prince William and his family on vacation in Jordan will feature on the family’s much-loved annual Christmas card. A post shared on Twitter and Instagram on Friday by Kensington Palace’s official channels shows Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton posing for a photo alongside their children George, Charlotte and Louis. The smiling family are shown sitting on a fur rug and what appears to be a traditional Jordanian carpet. The posts are captioned: “Delighted to share a new image of the family, which features on this year’s Christmas card.” The photo has already racked up over 600,000 likes on Instagram. Kensington Palace said it was taken “earlier this year.” Prince William — who is heir to the British throne after his father Charles — remarked in 2018 after an official visit to Jordan that he would love to take his family there. The two monarchies enjoy a longstanding relationship, and Prince Charles and his wife Camilla recently visited Jordan during a tour of the Middle East.
