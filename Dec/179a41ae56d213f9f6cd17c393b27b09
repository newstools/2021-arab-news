LONDON: Two of the UK’s biggest broadcasters have reached an agreement to share the rights to show the upcoming Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Sky Sports, which requires viewers to pay a subscription fee, reached the deal with free-to-air Channel 4 just days ahead of Sunday’s race, which has been billed as a “historic” Formula 1 clash that will see two of the sport’s top drivers face off. Britain’s Lewis Hamilton and Dutchman Max Verstappen, both currently level on points, will battle it out for the World Championship title. If Hamilton wins, he will claim his eighth world title. Verstappen is aiming for his first. Stephen van Rooyen, Sky’s EVP and CEO UK & Europe, said: “Sunday’s Grand Prix is one of the biggest sporting events in the last decade, and could be an historic moment for British sport. We’ve chosen to gift the race to the whole country at Christmas through our partnership with Channel 4, so everyone can be part of a huge national moment as Lewis Hamilton goes for a historic eighth World Championship title. “The brilliant Sky Sports Formula 1 team will give viewers on Channel 4 and Sky Sports the best insight, commentary and analysis of every twist and turn of this eagerly anticipated final race of the season.”
