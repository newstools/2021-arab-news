Al-Yamamah club have won the “Central” division of Saudi Arabia’s new women’s Regional Football League after a comprehensive 8-0 win over Ittihad Al-Riyadh club in the ninth and penultimate round of the competition. Noura Abdulmohsen and Al-Bandari Mubarak both scored hat-tricks for Al-Yamamah, while Lulwa Osama chipped in with two goals. Al-Yamama will officially be crowned with the Central Region Shield after the 10th and final round of action next Friday. The Regional Football League, organized by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, kicked off last month with 16 teams taking part in the first phase. Games have mostly been played in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. The league is split, as its name suggests, into three regions: A six-team Central region, a six-team Western region, and a four-team Eastern region. Matches will be played in a round-robin, home-and-away format, with the winner of each group declared champion of their region. The top three teams in the Central and Western regions, as well as the top two from the Eastern region, will progress to the national championships, which will be held in Jeddah at the start of next year. Elsewhere, Sama club managed to achieve its third victory in a row, defeating Blue Arrows 7-1. Sarah Muhammad scored a hat-trick for Sama, with the other goals coming from an Al-Anoud Ibrahim double, and one each by Al-Adha Fahd and Nour Al-Iman. Dina Howaidi scored a consolation goal for the Blue Arrows. Al-Tahadi defeated Al-Himma 6-1 in the penultimate round, as teams jostled to get into leading positions and ensure qualification for the national championships.
