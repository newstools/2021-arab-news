JEDDAH: The Saudi Geological Survey has launched the National Geological Database to mark the authority’s end of the year meeting. The initiative, which aims to contribute to achieving the goals of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 in the mining sector, was inaugurated on Wednesday by Deputy Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Mudaifer in the presence of Abdullah Al-Shamrani, CEO of the Saudi Geological Survey. The National Geological Database aims to be a platform that will provide accessible regional geological information to benefit researchers in the sector, in addition to giving detailed data on geological maps and geophysical surveys of mineral deposits in the Kingdom. The database will provide technical reports of exploration projects by the authority in the Kingdom that date back decades. It will also contain detailed geological data for mineral exploration wells.
