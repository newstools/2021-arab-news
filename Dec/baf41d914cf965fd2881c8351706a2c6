RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s FIFAe World Champion Musaed Al-Dossary, better known as MsDossary7, has visited the state-of-the-art Red Bull Athlete Performance Center on the outskirts of Salzburg as part of a series of sporting and gaming initiatives by the Austrian firm. The center is open to all Red Bull players and athletes, with the aim of helping them develop their careers and reach their goals. Many seasoned athletes, such as newly crowned Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen, Austria’s tennis Grand Slam ace Dominic Thiem, and Dakar Rally winner Sam Sunderland of the UK, have been part of the Red Bull APC. Al-Dossary, 21, said: “Being a champion demands you to train like a champion. I worked on my physical, mental, and nutritional health with experts at Red Bull Athlete Performance Center and look forward to making a strong comeback in the upcoming championship events.” On the center’s facilities, he added: “I am truly impressed by these facilities. Every competitor needs to work hard and train professionally to win. I can say that this center has helped me regain my strength, and I am hoping to secure a feat never achieved before: Winning multiple FIFAe world titles.” In 2018, Al-Dossary won the FIFAe World Cup Grand Final and was crowned the eSports Player of the Year. The three-time FUT Champions Cup winner is the first-ever Saudi esports league winner. Following his achievements, Al-Dossary was also invited to personally meet King Salman.
