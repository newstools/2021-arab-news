The Saudi Arabian embassy in the United States has denied in a post on Twitter that a ‘potential terrorist’ recently arrested by US authorities is a Saudi citizen.  Based on the engagement with the relevant U.S authorities on this matter, the Embassy confirms that the individual mentioned here is not a Saudi citizen. We will continue to coordinate with the US govt and bring forward any facts on this matter. https://t.co/u81j7Bisa4 — Saudi Embassy (@SaudiEmbassyUSA) December 21, 2021 This comes after American authorities falsely claimed that a suspect arrested in Arizona late last week was a 21-year-old Saudi national.  The Saudi embassy stated that it has contacted the relevant authorities in America on the matter, stressing that the person arrested for being a possible terrorist is not Saudi Arabian. “We will continue to coordinate with the US govt and bring forward any facts on this matter,” said the embassy on Twitter. US authorities said earlier that the “potential terrorist” has illegally entered the US from Mexico on Thursday night. It said the individual is linked to several Yemeni subjects of interest.
