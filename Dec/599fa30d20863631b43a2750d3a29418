RIYADH: The Ministry of Justice said the number of visits to its Scientific Judicial Portal had exceeded 13 million since it was launched in August, while the number of searches for judgments reached more than 10 million.
The ministry said the portal, which is an interactive digital platform and a judicial and legal database, includes around 46,000 judicial documents.
Bashar Al-Mufda, who is director general of the research center that oversees the portal project, said the platform gave the public, including the parties in a case and lawyers, easy access to final commercial rulings issued by courts of the first instance, appeal courts and the Supreme Court, in addition to other legal documents.
The portal targets judges, the parties involved in legal proceedings, lawyers, prosecutors, assistant judges, academics, and graduate students. The portal, which is an interactive digital platform and a judicial and legal database, includes around 46,000 judicial documents. He said the platform also aimed to promote justice and transparency, provide a unified electronic platform for judicial information, boost the judicial and academic community’s knowledge, and enrich the justice culture of society.
Al-Mufda said the portal was characterized by its accuracy, objective classification, arranging judgments with technical presentation templates, and modern presentation methods to guarantee ease of use and browsing, and the flexibility of navigating between the portal’s pages.
The ministry is also seeking to publish agreements, orders, decisions, scientific research, regulations and circulars, and other legal documents in the future.
The portal’s content is divided into six main sections: The monthly report on the development of laws, regulations, and circulars; the criminal procedure system; the legal pleading system and its executive regulations; bankruptcy provisions; the judgments of the commercial departments of the Supreme Court; and the decisions of commercial courts.
