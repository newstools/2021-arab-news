American aerospace manufacturer, space transformation services and communication corporation SpaceX has raised over $337m in fresh funding. Headquartered in California, the firm reached $100 billion in value after a secondary share in October and a $1.16 billion worth equity financing round earlier in April. Founded by Tesla's Elon Musk, it previously launched several cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. SpaceX is expected to land its reusable vehicles, also known as Starship rockets, on Mars sometime before 2030, Reuters reported.
