ABU DHABI: Majarra, one of the region’s leading Arabic digital content providers, has launched the Harvard Business Review Arabia skill for Alexa to provide daily management tips, making it among the first Arabic skills built for Alexa. The Arabic-language skill is part of Alexa’s flash briefing news skills, which provide short bursts of information to Alexa users. This particular skill offers users quick management tips when they ask Alexa in Arabic: “What’s new in business today?” “Majarra wants to be with our users wherever they are, and there is nothing easier than asking for Alexa’s help to get engaging, useful content on the go,” said Dia Haykal, director of brand and partnerships at Majarra. Haykal indicated that Majarra would be adding more content to Alexa in the future. “We are committed to offering our users the best Arabic content and making it available to them in the format that suits their needs and lifestyle,” she said. Earlier this year, following a rebrand from Haykal Media to Majarra, the company announced its plan to offer a network of high-quality online content platforms in Arabic through a single subscription. The network includes titles such as Harvard Business Review Arabia, MIT Technology Review Arabia, Stanford Social Innovation Review Arabia, Popular Science Arabia, Psychologies Nafseyati, Fortune and Man Hom, with more launches expected this year.
