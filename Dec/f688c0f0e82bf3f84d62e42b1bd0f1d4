RIYADH: Saudi-based financial services provider Sidra Capital has acquired the Houston 10,000 Energy Drive property, which was formerly the headquarters of the NYSE-listed oil and gas business Southwestern Energy. The property includes two connected LEED certified office towers comprising over 51,000 square metres of Class A leasable space, according to a statement. LEED is a green building rating system of the US Green Building Council. The acquisition reflects the company’s strategy of making investments that are aligned with emerging post-pandemic trends. This follows Sidra’s launch earlier this year of a $155 million fund to invest in industrial properties in the US. Sidra Capital has been investing in real estate there since 2016, with over 10 million square feet of leasable area acquired.
