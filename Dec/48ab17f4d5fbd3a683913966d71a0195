RIYADH: The Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance dismantled 1,630 mines in Yemen during the second week of December. This figure includes 26 anti-personnel mines, 747 anti-tank mines, 826 unexploded ordinances and 31 other explosive devices. The project is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the orders of King Salman to help ease the suffering of the Yemeni people. Saudi and international experts are removing mines planted by the Houthi militia in Marib, Aden, Al-Jawf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale, and Saada. A total of 293,561 mines have been cleared since the start of the project. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians. The project has 32 de-mining teams to protect civilians and ensure that urgent humanitarian supplies are delivered safely. It trains local de-mining engineers, gives them modern equipment and helps mine victims. In July, the project’s contract was extended for another year at a cost of $33.6 million.
