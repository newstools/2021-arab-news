RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Health reported 32 new COVID-19 cases and 28 recoveries on Tuesday.
It said there were 40 critical cases.
Its statistics show that the total number of infections in Saudi Arabia has increased to 549,752, while the total number of recoveries has risen to 538,913.
The ministry reported two new deaths, bringing the death toll to 8,836.
Authorities have advised everyone to contact the toll free 937 number for consultations and inquiries around the clock, and to obtain health information and services.
Meanwhile, The World Health Organization called Tuesday for countries to keep calm and take “rational” measures in response to the new, fast-spreading COVID variant omicron, which has sparked global panic.
“We call on all member states to take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing to countries.
“We still have more questions than answers about the effect of omicron on transmission, severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines,” he added.
