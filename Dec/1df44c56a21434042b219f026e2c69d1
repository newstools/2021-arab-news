DUBAI: TBWA Worldwide was this week named 2021 Global Agency of the Year by Adweek, the US-based publication covering the advertising and marketing industries. “In one of the most competitive years Adweek’s selection committee has ever seen, TBWA Worldwide was unanimously selected as 2021’s Global Agency of the Year,” said David Griner, international editor of Adweek. He added that the editors were not only impressed with the network’s “business growth and consistently high bar for creative,” but also its “clear focus on developing strong talent and elevating a new generation of innovative leadership for the industry.” TBWA Worldwide CEO Troy Ruhanen said: “Being named Global Agency of the Year — again — is a tremendous honor and a testament to the 10,000-plus creative minds in our collective whose talent, perseverance and ingenuity made this recognition a reality.” The agency’s key client wins include the likes of Philips, Moderna, Behr Paint Company, Lays, DHL and Procter & Gamble Media. The agency did lose key businesses, such as TD Bank, ANZ Bank and Mini, according to Adweek, but these were offset by other business wins. For example, ANZ Bank was replaced with a bigger account, National Australia Bank, and the loss of Mini was offset by the acquisition of other automotive business. Although TBWA did not disclose its growth numbers due to company policy, it said that the agency witnessed double-digit year-on-year growth in 2021, Adweek reported. “We are extremely proud and honored to have contributed to this global recognition,” said Reda Raad, Group CEO of TBWA\RAAD. “We’ve had a phenomenal year, both on a collective and regional level. We managed to thrive and grow our business and turn chaos into opportunity, thanks to our solid trusted partnerships with our clients, our brave pirates who consistently produce great work and our fantastic collective culture which brings us all together as one global team, breaking all boundaries,” he added.
