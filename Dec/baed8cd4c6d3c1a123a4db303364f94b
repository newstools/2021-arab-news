Wafrah for Industry and Development Co.’s announcement to increase the company’s capital by offering SR154 million rights issues to the Capital Market Authority led its shares to rise 6.24 percent. Naseej International Trading Co. and Al Khaleej Training and Education Co. came on top of the top losers list, dropping 5.59 percent and 2.56 percent respectively.
