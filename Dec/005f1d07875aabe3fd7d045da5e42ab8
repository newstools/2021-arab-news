RIYADH: The Arab coalition intercepted and destroyed two ballistic missiles fired toward Abha, southwestern Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The Houthis used Sanaa airport to launch the ballistic missiles to target civilians, the Arab coalition said. The militia launched a terrorist operation on Tuesday from Sanaa airport, details of which will be announced later, it added. Earlier, the coalition said that a hostile projectile fell in the industrial area of Ahad Al-Masarihah, Jazan. Three industrial workshops and three civilian vehicles were damaged as a result. Attempts to target civilian objects are a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, the coalition said.
