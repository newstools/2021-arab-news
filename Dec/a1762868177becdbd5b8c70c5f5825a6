JEDDAH: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has begun coordinating with Saudi Arabia, which hosts the OIC headquarters in Jeddah, and Pakistan about organizing an extraordinary meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and help provide an appropriate humanitarian response. OIC Secretary-General Hissein Brahim Taha said he values Saudi Arabia’s initiative that called for this important meeting, within the framework of the Kingdom’s efforts to enhance Islamic solidarity and joint Islamic work. He also praised Pakistan for its readiness to host the gathering, on Dec. 17, which he said confirms the nation’s keenness to support the Afghan people and enhance regional security and peace. He said he hopes that the outcome of the meeting will help to mitigate the suffering of the Afghan people and provide humanitarian assistance by finding appropriate mechanisms to do so in coordination with UN agencies and international financial institutions. Taha added that the meeting comes as an extension of OIC efforts in response to the situation in Afghanistan, and affirmed that OIC members seek to help establish and support peace, security, stability and development in the country. The OIC expressed grave concerns over the decline in the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan as a result of the influx of refugees and displaced people caused by conditions in the country and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It called on member states, Islamic financial institutions and other partners to work urgently to providing humanitarian aid in the worst-affected areas.
