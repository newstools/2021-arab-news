DUBAI: The Yemeni army thwarted a Houthi infiltration attempt on its positions in Saada province, state news agency SPA reported. The army targeted gatherings of the militia and its reinforcements, which resulted in the killing and wounding of multiple militants, while the rest fled, a military source said. Earlier, the Arab coalition airstrikes destroyed two caves used to store ballistic missiles and four secret drone facilities in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. The attacks came after Saudi Arabian forces destroyed a ballistic missile launched by Houthi militia and targeting Khamis Mushayt, near Abha in the Kingdom’s southwest, on Monday.
