RIYADH: Saudi police have arrested three people who destroyed a traffic monitoring device at Umwah governorate in the southwestern region of Asir, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday. The suspects bragged about shooting and destroying the Saher camera with a gun, and shared their criminal act on social media. Investigators later found that one of the trio was involved in arms trafficking. The suspects have been referred to the Public Prosecution agency, the SPA report said. Dozens of motorists had been criminally charged in the past for destroying Saher cameras when the monitoring scheme was first introduced in Saudi Arabia in the past few years. Traffic Department records across the Kingdom have shown violations such as speeding and running red lights dropping drastically since then.
