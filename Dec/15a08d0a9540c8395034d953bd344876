Dubai: Advertising and communications group Grey has appointed Pablo Maldonado as the new executive creative director of Grey Dubai. Maldonado will work closely with Managing Director Philippe Berthelot, and will be responsible for defining and driving the creative vision and strategy across Grey’s offerings. He will lead the creative output for key client accounts and all creative projects for the agency. “Pablo’s creative vision and expertise are much admired, and I know he will make a big impact in this part of the world just as he has been in other regions,” said Berthelot. Prior to joining Grey Dubai, Maldonado spent the last few years at Wunderman Thompson, most recently in the role of executive creative director. He played a key part in scoring the first-ever Cannes Grand Prix in Innovation for Argentina with the Buenos Aires office. The winning campaign, “Degree Inclusive,” for Unilever featured the world’s first deodorant designed for people with upper limb and visual disabilities. Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Maldonado’s 16-year advertising journey has seen him work at different agencies such as Publicis, Y&R, DDB, Mullen Lowe, and indie shops across different markets including Argentina, Mexico, and the US. He has created campaigns for brands such as Burger King, Bose, GSK, Philips, Renault, and Microsoft. He has won over 400 awards at creativity and effectiveness festivals around the world, and has also sat on juries for various awards. “This is an exceptional opportunity for me to leverage my experience and create innovative work for Grey in a region that is more eclectic than ever,” said Maldonado.
