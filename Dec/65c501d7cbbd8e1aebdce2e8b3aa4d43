JEDDAH: The Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently hosted a forum for a group that helps to find employment opportunities for people after they are released from prison. The National Committee for the Welfare of Prisoners and Their Families, also known as Tarahum, is backed by 21 companies and supports community projects
to help ex-convicts get back on their feet. The schemes are led by the Jeddah Chamber. As part of its Vision 2030 strategy and sustainable development goals, the Kingdom provides a range of support options for people leaving prison, designed to contribute to the advancement of the Saudi people as a whole. Ahmed bin Al-Hamda, who chairs Tarahum, told the forum that the committee has expanded its initiatives and programs to better serve this important section of society. In providing its services, Tarahum collaborates with 12 government bodies, including the Public Prosecution, Council of Saudi Chambers, and the Ministries of Health, Justice, Education, and Human Resources and Social Development. The committee also provides legal representation on a pro bono basis to prison inmates facing trial and helps to ensure former prisoners are aware of their rights as Saudi citizens. Lawyer Waleed bin Naif told Arab News that Tarahum provides a forum for legal professionals who want to volunteer their services to help prisoners. “One of the roles of the committee is to enable lawyers to communicate with prisoners while they are in detention, so that their rights are preserved,” he said.
