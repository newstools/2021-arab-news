RIYADH: Fans around the world will be tuning in to the inaugural Maradona Cup on Tuesday, which kicks off with a must-see matchup between Spanish giants, Barcelona and Argentine titans, Boca Juniors. The match will be played in honor of the late great Argentine maestro, Diego Armando Maradona, who passed away on Nov. 25 2020, sending shockwaves throughout the footballing world. Known for his flamboyant style on and off the pitch, few had such a lasting impact on the sport still felt to this day. During a press conference held in Riyadh on Monday, Xavi Hernandez, former Barcelona player-turned-current first team manager told reporters he grew up idolizing Maradona, and tomorrow's game will be much more than a friendly. He said he was honored and privileged to be a part of an event paying tribute to one of the sports biggest icons. The two teams participating in Tuesday's event have close ties to the late Argentine. Maradona donned the famous colors of Boca Juniors from 1981 to 1982. Shortly after, he transferred to Barcelona, where he went on to represent the club from 1982 to 1984. In such a short span of time Maradona was able to endear himself to the fans of both clubs and it is a testimony to his greatness that he is revered by both sets of fans as one of their greatest-ever players. Dani Alves, the Barcelona right back who is currently in his second stint for the club, said he feels nervous to be back at Barcelona but added it was the best decision of his career to return and is ready to give his “home” all he’s got in tomorrow's Maradona Cup, which will be his first game back since rejoining the club. The Maradona Cup match is one of a series of events being held for the first time as part of Riyadh Season 2021. Tomorrow's event promises to be an emotional day for fans attending the game and for the players themselves as they will look to deliver on the pitch and give the people a memorable game befitting the man it's set to honor.
