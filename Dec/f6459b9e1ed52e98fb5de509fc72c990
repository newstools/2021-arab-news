RIYADH: People in Saudi Arabia will be required to receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine eight months after getting double-jabbed to maintain their vaccinated status. As of February 1, 2022, adults aged 18 and above will need to have a booster dose in order to keep their fully vaccinated status on the Tawakkalna application, an interior ministry source said. Having a fully vaccinated status on the app allows people to do the following: 1. Take part in any economic, commercial, cultural, sports or tourist activity. 2. Attend any cultural, scientific, social or recreational event. 3. Enter any governmental or private establishment. 4. Travel on planes and public transport. Those exempt from taking the vaccine against coronavirus as listed on the app do not need to take the booster dose. The source stressed the need for everyone to adhere to all precautionary and preventive measures and approved health protocols.
