RIYADH: A volunteer medical team from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center examined 10,770 people, performed 580 eye surgeries and distributed 2,450 pairs of glasses in Sudan to combat blindness and its causes, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
The work was part of the voluntary medical campaigns being implemented by the Kingdom, through the center, with the aim of providing treatment to families and individuals with limited income, who cannot afford treatment costs, in different countries.
Meanwhile, the center has provided medical services to 503 Syrian patients in one day at Jordan’s Zaatari reugee camp.
General medicine clinics received 161 patients, while those responsible for internal medicine dealt with 42 people with diabetes, hypertension and asthma.
Ninety-seven patients visited pediatric centers and were treated at the emergency department, and two dental clinics handled 22 cases.  The clinics in the camp are small part of the humanitarian aid that the center provides to Syrian refugees.
