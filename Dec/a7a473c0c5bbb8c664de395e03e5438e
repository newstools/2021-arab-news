RIYADH: Saudi Deputy Minister for Consular Affairs Tamim Al-Dossary met the South African ambassador to the Kingdom, C. T. Rubushe, in Riyadh.
During talks, the two sides reviewed bilateral relations between the two countries and ways to develop them, along with issues of common interest.
Saudi Arabia and South Africa enjoy brotherly relations and are looking to boost bilateral trade following a pandemic-hit year that saw imports from the Kingdom fall to a four-year low in 2020.
