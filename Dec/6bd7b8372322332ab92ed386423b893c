Cairo: Egypt’s military announced that under the directives of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, tons of medical and pharmaceutical aid have been sent to South Sudan. The aid, transported by a military plane, was provided by the Ministry of Health and Population. Officials in South Sudan expressed their appreciation for Egypt’s support, which they said strengthens bilateral relations. During floods that swept South Sudan earlier this year, Egypt sent aid such as food and medical supplies.
