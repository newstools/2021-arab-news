DUBAI: The Saudi Chemical Company Holding has signed an initial agreement with French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi to explore manufacturing Clexane in Saudi Arabia. Clexane is a therapeutic solution that prevents and treats thrombosis, which may also “affect a significant percentage of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms,” the Saudi firm said in a bourse filing. Thrombosis is the formation of blood clot within a blood vessel which can lead to life-threatening complications such as stroke and heart attack. The MoU outlines Aja Pharma’s, a unit of SCCH, role to provide manufacturing facilities and systems to produce Clexane prefilled syringes in the Kingdom. The move comes amid France’s President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit in the Kingdom, where a number of deals between Saudi and French companies were signed. The agreement is also in line with the Kingdom’s push to localize critical industries, and drive economic growth with more local content.
