RIYADH: The Arab coalition said on Wednesday it intercepted and destroyed two drones in Yemeni airspace, one of which was monitored and launched from Sanaa airport.
“We are in the process of implementing strict operational measures to deal with the sources of the threat,” Saudi state TV reported citing the coalition.
Earlier on Wednesday, the coalition said it carried out 16 operations targeting the Houthi militia in Marib in the last 24 hours.
It said 95 militants were killed and 11 Houthi military vehicles were destroyed during the operation.
The coalition has stepped up operations targeting Houthi military targets after an increase in cross-border attacks in recent days aimed at Saudi Arabia.
The Kingdom’s defense ministry said Saudi air defenses intercepted and destroyed a hostile air target in the early hours of the morning that was headed toward the western region.
Spokesman Brig. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki said that the ministry “is taking all necessary measures and precautions to protect the security and safety of the Kingdom and protect its national capabilities, as well as civilians and civilian objects.”
He also said that the ministry “will take deterrent and resolute measures to stop such cross-border hostilities.” a statement on Saudi Press Agency reported.
