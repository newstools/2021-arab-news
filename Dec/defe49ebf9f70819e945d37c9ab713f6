The reboot’s screenwriter is Amr El-Daly from Egypt, and it will be directed by Jad Aouad from Lebanon, who will make his feature film debut.   The Arabic version, set in Egypt, tells the story of a wealthy Egyptian paraplegic and his relationship with a small-time hood who becomes his caretaker. The pair develop a strong connection, despite the wide social and cultural gap between them. “We’ve made it our mission to find and nurture emerging talent that we feel will have a profound impact and drive change in the creative industry,” said Front Row CEO Gianluca Chakra. “We’re very excited to be working with both Jad and Amr on ‘Intouchables.’ They have truly authentic voices and a natural instinct that will make this version unique for Arab viewers, while also translating well for international audiences.” The original show, which starred French actors Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet, was released in 2011 and made over $426 million in the international theatrical market.
