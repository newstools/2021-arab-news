RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s stock indexes snapped the year-end rally to end lower after a volatile session on Wednesday, Dec. 29, as pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions came into play. TASI index dropped 1 percent to close at 11,199 points, while the parallel market Nomu retreated nearly 3 percent to 25,952 points. The Kingdom announced that wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines will be mandatory in all indoor and outdoor events and activities from 07:00 a.m. on Thursday, Dec. 30. Data by the Saudi Health Ministry revealed a total of 744 new COVID-19 cases together with one virus-related death on Dec. 29. Along with the Saudi bourse, global and regional stock markets saw declines on Wednesday amid lingering uncertainty around the omicron strain. In the GCC region where the Kingdom led the downturn, the UAE’s main index DFMGI dropped 0.8 percent, followed by Oman’s MSX30 which closed 0.1 percent lower. Bourses of Qatar and Kuwait ended flat, while Abu Dhabi and Bahrain’s stock main indexes went up by 0.7 and 0.2 percent, respectively. Apart from the Gulf, the Egyptian index EGX30 lost 0.1 percent.
