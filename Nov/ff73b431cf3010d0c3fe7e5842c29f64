CAIRO: An investigation has been launched into violations committed against protesters since the military power grab on Oct. 25, Sudan’s newly reinstated Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said, according to a statement from his office.
	Hamdok’s comments came during a meeting on Tuesday evening with a group from the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), the main civilian coalition opposing military rule. FFC had previously said on Sunday that it does not recognize any political agreement with the military leadership.
	The group stressed during the meeting the importance of laying out a roadmap to implementing the political agreement, reversing all political appointments that took place after the military takeover and reinstating all those who were fired during that period, according to the statement.
	Last week, protesters and a Reuters witness said they saw security forces chase protesters into neighborhoods and homes to carry out arrests. At least 15 people were shot dead during the anti-coup protests, according to medics.
	Hamdok and the group called for political prisoners to be released as soon as possible and for the right to peacefully protest to be respected.
	Under the agreement signed with military leader General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, Hamdok, first appointed after the overthrow of former President Omar Al-Bashir in a 2019 uprising, will lead a civilian government of technocrats for a transitional period.
	The deal faces opposition from pro-democracy groups that have demanded full civilian rule since Bashir’s ouster and have been angered by the deaths of dozens of protesters since the Oct. 25 coup.
