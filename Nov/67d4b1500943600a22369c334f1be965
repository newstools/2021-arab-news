CAIRO: Ibrahim Ghandour, head of Sudan’s former ruling National Congress Party and a former foreign minister under deposed President Omar Al-Bashir, was re-arrested on Monday, a day after he was released from jail, according to a source from his family.
	Ghandour had been previously detained under orders of a taskforce intended to dismantle and prevent the return of the Bashir rule which ended in 2019.
