LONDON: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi held talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday, where the two sides agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation on security, defense, education and trade.
	The two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland.
	“They agreed that Glasgow must be a pivotal moment for countries to deliver real action on coal, cars, cash and trees, looking ahead to Egypt’s Presidency of COP27 next year,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement.
	El-Sisi and Johnson also called for the need for all countries to transition to renewable energy.
	They also “agreed to work together closely at COP26 and beyond to secure ambitious change on climate change and ensure the benefits of green technology and growth are felt around the world,” 10 Downing Street said.
