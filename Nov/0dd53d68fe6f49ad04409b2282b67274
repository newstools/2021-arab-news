RIYADH: Afghans are facing a rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis this winter and millions of people are in need of immediate assistance, including access to food, medicine, and shelter, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
An impending economic collapse and further deterioration of living conditions will lead to more instability within Afghanistan, which will adversely affect regional and international peace and security.
Saudi Arabia has called on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to urgently convene an extraordinary ministerial meeting to discuss the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and pathways for a humanitarian response.
Pakistan has offered to host this meeting in Islamabad on Dec. 17.
The Kingdom hopes that the meeting results in finding appropriate means and mechanisms to deliver aid to Afghans, and to coordinate procedures with relevant UN agencies, international financial institutions, and the global community to mitigate the humanitarian impact and alleviate the suffering of Afghans.
The Kingdom hopes it will also serve as an opportunity to demonstrate a collective stance on key principles.
These include the importance of taking steps to ensure Afghanistan’s security and stability and preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity, free from external interference, while rejecting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and ensuring that Afghan territory is not used as a refuge or haven for terrorist and extremist groups.
This meeting should also urge the interim government in Afghanistan to be more inclusive, to abide by international norms and conventions, and to respect human rights and women’s rights to work and education granted in Islam.
The Kingdom urges member states, international organizations, and invited countries to actively participate in this extraordinary ministerial meeting in order to mobilize Islamic and international action to help Afghans.
