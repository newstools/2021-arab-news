RIYADH: Commercial lease contracts registered online increased by 44 percent during 2021 year-on-year, the Saudi Press Agency reported citing Ejar. The contracts exceeded 200,000 for the 10 months to October 2021, the online platform revealed. The scheme attributed the increase in online rental contracts to its continuous efforts to develop and renew services and new strategic partnerships, the latest of which was linking with the National Water Company. This enables the beneficiaries of the network to transfer the water meter account to the actual user name of the real estate unit registered in the rental program. Ejar is an integrated system that aims to develop the housing and real estate sector in Saudi Arabia. The Ejar program aims to develop and renew services and strategic partnerships, and organize and stimulate investment in the real estate market.
