Bahrain will increase refining capacity from 267,000 to 380,000 barrels per day through the Bapco Modernisation Programme (BMP),  which is the largest industrial project in the history of Bahrain. As part of the new strategy, the private developers will be able to bid for contracts to develop government land through the Sharaka program.
