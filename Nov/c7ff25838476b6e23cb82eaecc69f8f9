US climate envoy John Kerry said on Wednesday that current commitments on cutting carbon emissions meant the world had a 60 percent chance of capping a rise in the average temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Speaking at a breakfast event with world mayors at global climate talks in Glasgow, he said with the most recent commitments made at COP26, around 65 percent of global GDP was now covered by implementable climate change plans. “But that means 35 percent isn’t. And we can’t do it without that 35 percent.”
