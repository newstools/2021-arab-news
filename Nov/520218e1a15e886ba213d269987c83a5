Mardhyah Palace is where King Abdulaziz would spend his leisure time whenever he visited Al-Ahsa, in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province.
	The palace is located in the town of Al-Fudul, and is surrounded by palm trees and groves. The architecture is true to Al-Ahsa’s
	history and most of the building is still standing even after a partial collapse.
	The two-story palace has ceilings that are built from wood. On the ground floor there is a reception area, also known as a majlis, and this space is decorated with carved plaster arches.
	The majlis on the first floor is called the banqala due to the windows that illuminate the whole floor and allow visitors to look over the magnificent spread of palm trees.
	The Kingdom’s Tourism Ministry is currently working toward the restoration of the building to preserve the rich history within its walls so that future generations can witness it.
