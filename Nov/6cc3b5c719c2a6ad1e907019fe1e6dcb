ATHENS: Greece recorded 5,449 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, authorities said on Monday, the highest single-day figure since the pandemic began early last year.
	Another 52 people died from COVID-19 over the past day, taking the total to 15,990 among 747,595 COVID-19 cases.
	Giannis Oikonomou, a spokesman for the government, said it was “pressing” to increase the number of vaccinations, which have been moving at a slower pace than authorities anticipated.
	“We’re not done with COVID yet. As long as there are unvaccinated people, the virus finds a suitable ground to spread,” Oikonomou told a regular news briefing on Monday.
	“We mourn the loss of human lives due to non-vaccination, and this cannot, and should not, continue.”
	About 60.5 percent of Greeks are vaccinated against COVID-19, less than the European Union average of 64.7 percent, according to the latest available data.
