DUBAI: Bahrain security forces arrested a number of suspected militants ahead of a planned attack and confiscated weapons and explosives that had come from Iran, the interior ministry said on its official Twitter on Monday.
	The ministry did not say how many people were arrested or specify their nationalities. It described them as “linked with terrorist groups in Iran” and said they were “plotting terrorist operations against security and civil peace.”
	Bahrain, host to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet and other international naval operations, has often accused Shiite Muslim Iran of seeking to subvert the Sunni-ruled kingdom, which has a Shiite majority. Iran has denied such charges.
	Last year, Bahrain said it had foiled a “terrorist attack” backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. As part of efforts to protect national security, a proactive security operation in cooperation with the National Intelligence Agency, the CID: Terrorists arrested for plotting terrorist operations against security and civil peace. — Ministry of Interior (@moi_bahrain) November 22, 2021  PT: Weapons and explosives from Iran were seized from the arresttees who are linked with terrorist groups in Iran. — Ministry of Interior (@moi_bahrain) November 22, 2021  Developing
