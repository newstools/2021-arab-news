LONDON: Queen Rania of Jordan has voiced her concerns for Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II but told Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, that the monarch was “a strong woman.” Rania spoke about the queen’s health after she canceled her Remembrance Sunday appearance due to a sprained back. The Jordanian queen is hosting Prince Charles and the duchess on the first overseas tour by senior royals since the pandemic began. Camilla was taken on a tour of Amman by Rania in a Tesla in a possible nod to Prince Charles’ environmentalist efforts and recent work with the UN Climate Change Conference. The Jordanian royals are famed for their links with automobiles, with monarchs past and present often seen driving flashy motors in the country. After driving to a children’s hospital in the electric vehicle, Rania spoke to Britain’s ITV News about the queen, who is limited to desk duties on the advice of her doctors. She said: “We’re always concerned for her health, but she is a strong woman and even at this age is very active.” Rania said the queen is “somebody I look up to personally” and a “symbol of what it means to be a true figurehead and stateswoman and just giving inspiration to the rest of the world.”
