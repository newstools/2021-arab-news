CAIRO: Saudi inflation rate is on the rise for the second month in a row. The annual inflation rate reached 0.8 percent in October, up from September’s 0.6 percent, according to data released by Saudi’s General Authority for Statistics (Gastat). Inflationary pressures were driven by higher prices of the food and beverages index and costlier transport, which increased by 1.4 percent and 6.4 percent respectively, according to Gastat. The country's inflation rate is now also higher than its 20-month low in August, when it stood at 0.3 percent.
