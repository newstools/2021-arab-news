JEDDAH: Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Asheikh on Friday met Egyptian Minister of Endowments Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar Jumaa.
During their meeting in Jeddah, they discussed a number of issues including cooperation between the two ministries on Islamic initiatives, and spreading the messages of temperance, moderation, and the rejection of extremism.
Meanwhile, Al-Asheikh noted the success of recent talks on similar topics with Yaqut Choilil Coumas, the Indonesian minister of religious affairs.
Coumas pointed out that the two countries had parallel visions, and said Indonesia was keen to benefit from Saudi Arabia’s expertise in serving the Two Holy Mosques.
The Indonesian minister added that as well as tackling groups that tried to exploit Islam for political gain, his country also aimed to build strategic partnerships to train and qualify preachers and imams to achieve its goals.
