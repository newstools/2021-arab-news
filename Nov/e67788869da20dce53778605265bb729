DUBAI: TikTok has launched the T-Talks series in the Middle East and North Africa region. The new series brings together inspirational people to share everything from stories of courage to viewpoints on causes that matter. The idea behind T-Talks came from TikTok’s identity as an online space that inspires positivity, and creativity, according to a company statement. “T-Talks continues the grassroots work we are doing to drive positive conversations on the platform, and we look forward to continuing to share inspiring stories of our creators, talents and users throughout the series,” said Hany Kamel, content operations director at TikTok MENA. The first T-Talks series is called #VoicesForHope and comprises three episodes. The first two episodes feature breast cancer survivors Tina Chagoury and Sian Moss, who beat cancer with the support of family and friends. The aim of the #VoicesForHope series was to continue raising awareness about breast cancer following October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. “Breast cancer awareness shouldn’t be limited to just one month — detection is critical all year round,” said Chagoury. “TikTok is one of those platforms that reaches a massive younger audience, and this is where our voices need to be heard.” Kamel added: “Community sits at the heart of everything we do at TikTok. Our community is our pride and joy, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to give them a voice, and a platform where they can inspire and be inspired.” T-Talks will continue to feature figures spotlighting important topics such as mental health and stories of determination.
