GLASGOW: The Red Sea Development Co. has already started implementing projects to protect and preserve the area where the company plans to build the world's largest sustainable tourism destination, its head of environment and sustainability said. The company, known as TRSDC, has started a waste management system to handle waste from construction even during its early stages of development, Raed Albasseet said on the sidelines of COP26. TRSDC is now one of the top ranking sustainable tourism developers of the world as it scored high in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. The developer behind the world’s most ambitious regenerative tourism project achieved an overall score of 91 out of 100 in this year’s ESG-assessment and benchmark exercise by GRESB, up from 84 a year ago. Last month, it has signed a single multiple deal to operate nine hotels that will open in the first phase of the Red Sea development project next year. International hospitality firms will run nine of the 16 properties under development taking over more than 1,700 hotel rooms of 3000 for the first phase of the project. The tourism development on Saudi Arabia’s west coast is set to be completed in 2030 and will offer 50 hotels with up to 8,000 hotel rooms and around 1,000 residential properties across 22 islands and six inland sites.
