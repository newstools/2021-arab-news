DUBAI: Newcastle United are reportedly hoping to sign Arsenal’s former manager Unai Emery as their new coach ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash against Brighton. Emery, currently coaching Spanish side Villarreal, has surfaced as a leading candidate to replace outgoing manager Steve Bruce. The BBC reported that work remains to be done over attracting Emery to the role, given the 49-year-old’s contract with the Spanish club runs until 2023. Over 12 days have passed since Bruce left his position as United’s manager by mutual consent, just two weeks after they were taken over by a Saudi Arabian-backed consortium. Bruce had appeared to be on borrowed time after the Premier League announced earlier this month that Newcastle had been sold to the group led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. According to various UK media outlets, the club have also contacted former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe and ex-Roma manager Paulo Fonseca over the role. In the press conference ahead of Villarreal’s Champions League match against Swiss side Young Boys on Tuesday, Emery said he was not aware of any links with Newcastle. According to Sky Sports, it could take as much as £5 million ($6.8 million) in compensation to release Emery from his current deal.
