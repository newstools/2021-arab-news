If you’re in Jeddah and looking of a cozy but vibrant place to chill and chat with friends or family, then Patisserie Sucré Salé — a local favorite back in the Nineties — on Prince Saud Al-Faisal Road in the city’s Al-Rawdah district is worth checking out. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle It offers a genuine café experience, with a mix of unique pastries from a range of international cuisines and cultures. Highlights include the delicious maamoul, the ghuraiba, and the mille feuille, but nothing beats the mango tres leches cake (also available in mixed-berry flavor). For those who prefer a savory snack, Sucré Salé’s signature dish is avocado toast with a breakfast burrito. Sucré Salé opened in 1995 as a takeaway pastry shop. The original owner’s eldest daughter took over six years ago and relaunched the brand, adding a breakfast/brunch dine-in experience. The café also caters for those with dietary restrictions, offering gluten-free and vegan cakes on request. For more information visit Instagram @sucresale_jeddah.
