RIYADH: Germany’s inflation would notably decline at the beginning of the next year as the effects of one-off factors soften, the country's Economy Ministry said on Monday. The temporary decrease in the value-added tax rate in the middle of 2021 helped inflation to increase to 4.5 percent in October. Higher prices of raw materials and a rise in energy prices also contributed to the hike in inflation Additionally, supply bottlenecks have become more widespread, meaning that the industrial output is likely to remain weak in the coming year despite the large number of orders. Moreover, the county’s output is expected to expand slightly in the fourth quarter of the year, the ministry added.
