RIYADH: The M3 monetary aggregate, known as “broad money,” posted an annual growth rate of 7.9 percent in October, having decelerated slightly from the September value of 8.4 percent, according to data published by the Saudi Central Bank. On a monthly basis, the M3 indicator grew by SR10.6 billion ($2.8 billion) in October, or 0.5 percent from the previous month. The monthly increase in M3 money supply was driven mainly by the SR15.1 billion increase in time and saving deposits, which grew 3.3 percent month-on-month, the fastest rate of growth since October 2020. Demand deposits fell by SR4.5 billion, or 0.2 percent, to SR1.324 trillion as of Oct. 31.
