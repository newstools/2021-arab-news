JEDDAH: The final countdown for the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix began in earnest as Formula One teams arrived to a colorful welcome at Jeddah’s King Abdul Aziz International Airport on Nov. 28. Teams were greeted by Ministry of Sports and Saudi Arabian Automobile and Motorcycle Federation “meet and greet” team, and were assisted with arrival formalities in a specially constructed lounge reception area. The Formula One event — the Kingdom’s biggest global sporting showcase — will be staged at the specially built Jeddah Corniche Circuit from Dec. 3-5. More F1 drivers are due to arrive in the coming days as the grand prix countdown continues. The Alpine F1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari are among teams that have already begun preparations in Jeddah. Airport lounges have been decorated with Formula 1 flags and logos, models of F1 racing cars, and images of competing teams and drivers. Jeddah Municipality has also decorated the King Road and the Corniche with Formula 1 flags and slogans, including the area surrounding the circuit and the waterfront.
