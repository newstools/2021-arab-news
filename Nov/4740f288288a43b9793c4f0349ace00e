LONDON: Jordan has called on its nationals in Ethiopia to “exercise the utmost caution” and try to leave the east African country “as soon as possible.”
“In view of the developments in the emergency situation in Ethiopia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates renews its call to Jordanian citizens present in Ethiopia to exercise the utmost caution and work to leave the country as soon as possible,” it said in a statement.
The ministry had issued a similar statement on Nov. 6 after fighting between government forces and rebels from the Tigray region intensified and has been drawing nearer to the capital, Addis Ababa. 
“The ministry also calls upon Jordanian citizens not to travel to Ethiopia during this period,” it said, adding assistance to nationals can be provided through the embassy in Addis Ababa.
