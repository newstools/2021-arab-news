DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco is marking the start of its development of the Jafurah unconventional gas field on Nov. 29. The Saudi-listed firm claims it to be the “largest non-associated gas field” in the Kingdom. The move is part of the Kingdom’s push to commercialize its unconventional resources and expand Aramco’s integrated gas portfolio.
