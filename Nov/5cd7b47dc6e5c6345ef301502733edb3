DUBAI: Regional leaders on Sunday condemned the attempt to target Iraq’s prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi in Baghdad, who survived an assassination attempt with an armed drone and is unharmed. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, and the Arab League have all issued statements condemning the attack on the prime minister. Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Nayef Al-Hajraf condemned the attack, saying the bloc considers the security of Iraq as one of the GCC states. Egypt’s president has also condemned the attempt to assassinate Al-Kadhimi and affirmed his country’s support for Iraq to protect its security and stability. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi called "for calm and restraint" among all the parties involved. Meanwhile, Iran’s top security official, Ali Shamkhani, condemned on Sunday, calling it “a new sedition.” “The attempt ... is a new sedition that must be traced back to foreign think-tanks,” he said on Twitter, without giving further details.
