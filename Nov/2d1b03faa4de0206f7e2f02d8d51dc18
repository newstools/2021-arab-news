DUBAI: Jordan launched this week a plan to protect the country from any infectious diseases that might spread from its border crossing, state news agency Petra reported. Minister of Health Firas Hawari’s initial plan will focus on Jordan's border crossings in Mudawara, King Hussein Bridge, and Passenger Terminal - Aqaba Port. The plan will introduce specialized equipment and train staff, Hawari said, adding that the “development of a comprehensive plan for crossings' emergency response will be made in consultation and coordination with the relevant authorities.” Preparing plans for the various crossings is aimed at creating "clear" guidelines, he noted, which will explain the roles of different sectors in responding to public health emergencies.
