ABU DHABI: Foreign nationals and citizens of GCC countries can now enter the UAE through land ports and border points starting Tuesday, Nov. 23. That’s according to an announcement made by the Federal Authority for identity and Citizenship (FAIC) and National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority (NCEMA). The updated protocol clarifies that people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 with any of the approved vaccines will need to present a negative PCR test result that does not exceed 14 days in order to be granted entry. If visitors are staying for six consecutive days in the country, they will be required to undergo PCR testing on the sixth day of entering the UAE. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people will also be allowed in if they can present a negative PCR test result that does not exceed 72 hours. Additional testing is mandatory on the fourth day of entering the UAE, if they’re staying for four consecutive days or more, and on the eighth day if they’re staying for eight days or more. Both authorities stressed the importance of visitors’ compliance to the country’s preventative measures, which include wearing masks, following social distancing rules and sterilizing luggage. They also advised people with chronic diseases or COVID-19 symptoms to avoid traveling.
