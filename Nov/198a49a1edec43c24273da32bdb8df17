CAIRO: Egypt’s government on Monday began implementing a decision not to allow workplace entry to state-sector employees who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine unless they take a weekly PCR test. Cabinet spokesman Nader Saad said failing to do so will be considered an interruption of work and legal measures will be taken. “We’re facing a dangerous epidemic. The vaccine is the only way to survive,” he added. Saad also confirmed that all government agencies will refrain from providing services to any citizen who has not received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Dec. 1. He said there are three ways to prove that a citizen or employee has been inoculated: A card from a vaccination center, the automated electronic certificate issued by the Health Ministry, and via the government app. Saad added that university employees and students will not be allowed to enter from Monday unless they submit a certificate proving that they have obtained their first vaccine dose. He said the problem lies with registration, not citizens’ willingness to be vaccinated. When mobile vaccination units were provided there was severe overcrowding, he added. There is no shortage of doses as close to 38 million have not yet been used, Saad said. Acting Health Minister Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar announced the rolling out of vaccine centers in subway stations, in coordination with the Transport Ministry.
