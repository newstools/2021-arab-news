DUBAI: Leading Arabic streaming platform Shahid has launched a new user interface entirely in French. This marks the launch of its third interface available to subscribers globally. Aimed at French-speaking users from territories including North Africa, Europe, Canada, and the Levant, the brand-new French interface comes with a host of features similar to those available in Arabic and English. Not only will subscribers be able to navigate the service in French, they will also be able to watch content subtitled in their preferred language. “French is the fifth largest language in the world and the third amongst the Arab population, so it made sense for the world’s leading Arabic streaming platform to offer the language as an option,” said Natasha Hemingway, chief commercial and marketing officer, Shahid. As part of its efforts targeting French speakers, Shahid is also adding new French and North African series and other shows over the coming months. These include the award-winning French drama “Stalk,” the Algerian-Syrian drama series, “Ward Aswad,” and the French thriller “Inside.” “This has been a work in progress for some time, and so we’re immensely excited for our users – who speak French as a first or second language, or just simply want to work on their French – to try and experience it,” Hemingway added.
