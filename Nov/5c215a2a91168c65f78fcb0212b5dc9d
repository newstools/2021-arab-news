RIYADH: Paris-based Bouygues S.A. is making its largest-ever deal after agreeing to buy Equans, the service unit of French energy giant Engie, for 7.1 billion euros ($8.2 billion). The deal will be one of the biggest deals in France this year. “This is the biggest acquisition Bouygues has ever made,” Chief Executive Officer Olivier Roussat said in a statement on Saturday. The merger between Equans and Bouygues’ Energies & Services arm will create a new standalone business segment with sales of 16 billion euros and 96,000 employees, of which 74,000 will come from Equans. Chairman Martin Bouygues said in a statement that the acquisition - the biggest Bouygues has ever made - aims to create a new global leader in multi-technical services.
