JEDDAH: Saudi customs authorities have foiled an attempt to smuggle 3,612 bottles of wine into the Kingdom via Jeddah Islamic Port.
	Security officers from the Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority found the wine carefully hidden in a shipping consignment passing through the Red Sea port.
	Two suspected recipients of the seized goods in the country were arrested.
	The authority said that it is continuing to tighten customs controls over the Kingdom’s imports and exports as part of its strategy.
	It called on members of the public to help its mission and protect society by contacting the designated number for security reports (1910), email (1910@zatca.gov.sa) or by using the international number (00966114208417).
