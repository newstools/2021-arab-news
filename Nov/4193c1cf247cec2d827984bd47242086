JEDDAH: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has welcomed the UN Security Council’s addition of three Houthi leaders to the international sanctions blacklist. Council members agreed by consensus to impose sanctions on the Houthi head of the general staff leading the militia’s Marib offensive, Muhammad Abd Al-Karim Al-Ghamari; a leader of Houthi forces assigned to the Marib advance, Yusuf Al-Madani; and the Houthi’s assistant defense minister for logistics, Saleh Mesfer Saleh Al-Shaer.
	The trio were put on the list on the grounds that they were considered a direct threat to peace, security, and stability in Yemen, while also being responsible for attacks on Yemeni civilians, and causing a humanitarian catastrophe. UN Security Council members agreed by consensus to impose sanctions on the Houthi head of the general staff leading the militia’s Marib offensive, Muhammad Abd Al-Karim Al-Ghamari; a leader of Houthi forces assigned to the Marib advance, Yusuf Al-Madani; and the Houthi’s assistant defense minister for logistics, Saleh Mesfer Saleh Al-Shaer. The OIC said it hoped the UN move would help curtail the group’s activities and cut its supplies of missiles, drones, and money for weapons which were used against the Yemeni people and to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia and international shipping.
	Officials also reiterated the organization’s support for Yemen and its legitimate government and called on the international community to press for an end to the crisis in the country that was causing mass human suffering.
	The Kingdom’s Foreign Ministry expressed hope that the blacklisting would contribute to putting an end to the activities of the Houthi militia and its supporters.
