RIYADH: The General Motors Factory ZERO EV assembly plant is now set to become operational at the former Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant, the company said in a statement. The “milestone” was achieved in less than two years after GM announced the massive $2.2 billion investment to fully renovate the facility to build a variety of all-electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. “GM’s manufacturing expertise is key to achieving our all-electric future,” said GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra. “This is a monumental day for the entire GM team. We retooled Factory ZERO with the best, most advanced technology in the world to build the highest quality electric vehicles for our customers.” The new production process will feed one of two distinct strategic business pillars of GM Middle East — supplying the many EVs that will accelerate the regional future of mobility agenda across electrification, autonomy and connectivity, through a green circular economy. “Regionally, the launch of Factory Zero strengthens our standing as a leader in the future of mobility. Majority of the nations in the Middle East are actively working to achieve their net-zero plan, most of which tackle transport solutions. This is promising when we look at the future adoption of our EV and AV portfolio, which are now a step closer to being on Middle Eastern roads, following the large-scale production to take place at Factory Zero,” said Luay Al-Shurafa, president and managing director at General Motors Africa and Middle East.
