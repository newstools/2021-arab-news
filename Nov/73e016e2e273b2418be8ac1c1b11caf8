JEDDAH: The 2022 Dakar Rally will involve participants from 70 different countries when it takes place in January. The rally will take place in the Kingdom in January, starting from Hail and finishing in Jeddah. France will have the biggest number of drivers taking part, followed by Holland and Italy, organisers said on Sunday. Prince Khalid bin Sultan Al-Abdullah Al-Faisal, Chairman of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation, said the number of participants this year reflects the huge interest in the rally and the trust placed in Saudi Arabia to host the biggest international events. The 2022 course includes more stages in the vast sand dunes of the Empty Quarter. “I love the idea of having more sand, for on board a motorcycle you risk to hit more rocks, while on board a car you become slower because of punctures,” Spanish motorcycle champion Laia Sanz said. “The Dakar Rally, with more sand dunes and new stages was what we were looking for, for Saudi Arabia is a huge country and has a lot of fascinating natural landscapes.” Saudi driver Yazeed Al-Rajhi said he expected a total change with the 2022 course. After start from Hail, competitors will head to Riyadh for a rest day before heading to the south-east and then across to the Red Seafor the final stages into Jeddah.
