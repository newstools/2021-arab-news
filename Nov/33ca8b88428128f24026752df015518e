CAIRO: Al-Azhar’s Grand Imam Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb has expressed his happiness at meeting Britain’s Prince Charles.
	“I was pleased to meet Prince Charles at (Egypt’s) Al-Azhar Mosque, and I found in him a wise and responsible leader, and a fair Western voice in his talk about Islam and Muslims,” Al-Tayeb tweeted.
	“We discussed the importance of promoting interfaith dialogue, the climate change crisis, and the need to find radical solutions to reduce its danger.”   Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, duchess of Cornwall, toured the mosque campus accompanied by Al-Tayeb.
	Prince Charles discussed with professors and students their ideas about interfaith harmony and tolerance.
	He and Camilla arrived in Cairo on Thursday for a two-day visit, and were received by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and his wife. Prince Charles also met with Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II.
	Gareth Bailey, Britain’s ambassador to Cairo, tweeted: “From the splendor of the pyramids, to the wonders of the new Library of Alexandria, I thank their Royal Highnesses for coming here. I thank our Egyptian hosts for the warm welcome.”   This is the second official visit of Prince Charles and his wife to Egypt. Their first was in 2006, as part of a world tour that included Saudi Arabia, with the aim of promoting interfaith understanding and tolerance, supporting environmental initiatives, and encouraging sustainable job opportunities and training for youths.
	He also visited Egypt in August 1981 with the late Princess Diana for their honeymoon, and were received by the late President Anwar Sadat and his wife.
