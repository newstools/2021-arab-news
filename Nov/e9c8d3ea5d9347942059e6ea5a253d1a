CAIRO: The Syrian Observatory said explosions were heard early Wednesday after airstrikes targeted weapon depots and sites that belong to Iranian militia in the city of Al-Bukamal, east of Deir Ezzor. Activists reporting to the observatory said loud explosions were heard overnight after strikes by unknown aircraft, which led to the destruction of weapons and ammunition depots in the city, which lies near the Iraqi-Syrian border. The observatory said it remain unclear whether the aircrafts that carried the attacks were affiliated with the international coalition or Israel.
