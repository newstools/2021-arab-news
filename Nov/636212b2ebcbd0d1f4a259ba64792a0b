DUBAI: Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, made a surprise appearance at Expo 2020 Dubai on Monday, meeting with young footballers at the exhibition’s City Football Schools’ site. Guardiola, the coach of the current Premier League champions, was visiting Dubai during the ongoing international break and following the club’s recent derby win over rivals Manchester United. “It was such a surprise to see Pep Guardiola coming through the gate during the session,” said Mohammad, 8. “He’s the best manager in the world, and we got to play in front of him and speak with him which was so cool. I just hope he saw my step-overs.” In his first visit to Expo 2020, the City coach visited the UAE’s pavilion before heading over to the UK’s pavilion in the Opportunity district to get a glimpse of the future of AI technology. “It’s incredible and has been a wonderful experience to witness the energy of grassroots football here at Expo 2020 Dubai, and to see how the club connects with people around the world,” said Guardiola. “The enthusiasm for the game demonstrated by the next generation of aspiring players is marvellous. “I was really happy to see the kids playing, and hopefully some of them will have the opportunity to train in Manchester in the future,” he added. Sholto Douglas-Home, chief sales and marcomms officer at Expo 2020 Dubai, said: “It’s a privilege to have Pep Guardiola here on site today at Expo 2020 Dubai. Pep is one of the most inspirational coaches and innovative tacticians in the world, and we’re delighted to show him what the future may hold and for him to experience the Expo here in the UAE.”
