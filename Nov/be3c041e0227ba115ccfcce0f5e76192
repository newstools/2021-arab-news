BERLIN: This time, another goal from Robert Lewandowski wasn’t enough for Bayern Munich.
	Augsburg held on to stun the Bundesliga leader with a 2-1 win in their Bavarian derby Friday to climb out of the relegation zone.
	It was only Augsburg’s third win in 21 league games against its powerful southeastern neighbor, which fell to its second defeat of the season. Bayern had won 16 of their previous 20 meetings.
	Augsburg started with intent, playing at pace and not allowing the visitors any time to settle. The home team challenged for every ball and forced Bayern’s stars into mistakes.
	Mads Pedersen got the deserved opener in the 23rd minute when he let fly inside the far corner after Lucas Hernandez could only deflect a cross into his path.
	The home fans were celebrating again in the 35th, when André Hahn met Iago Amaral Borduchi’s cross with a thumping header past Manuel Neuer after Marcel Sabitzer lost the ball in midfield.
	But Lewandowski pulled one back almost immediately afterward, set up by Thomas Müller on his 600th competitive game for Bayern. It was the Poland star’s 14th goal in 12 league games this season.
	Augsburg’s intensity dropped somewhat in the second half, when Lewandowski fired a good chance over.
	Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann brought on Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies in the 52nd to give his team more attacking threat, then Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting for the final 20 minutes.
	But his team missed other chances to equalize even as Augsburg dropped further back, and Borussia Dortmund can cut Bayern’s lead to a point if it manages to beat Stuttgart at home on Saturday.
