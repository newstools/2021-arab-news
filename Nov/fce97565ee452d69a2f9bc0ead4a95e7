JEDDAH: With just two weeks to go until the long-awaited debut of the Formula One STC Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (SAGP), the world’s fastest and longest street track, the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, is set to be completed in the coming days. Work on the track only began last April — no F1 circuit has been constructed so quickly, which is a testament to the dedication of the Saudi Grand Prix’s workforce, who have been striving to deliver the racetrack on time. The completion of the circuit was accomplished under the strictest health and safety conditions, with millions of man-hours of work taking place on site with no serious incidents. All work was carried out according to Saudi Arabian Labour Laws, guaranteeing the protection of the rights of workers on-site, including the limiting of working hours in direct sunlight. All workers were required to participate in the ATLAS safety induction programme. The promoter worked with 3,000 on-site contractors from approximately 50 companies. While many of these partners are Saudi Arabian, the event organizers also used suppliers from Germany, Austria, the UK, Spain and Italy. Developed in partnership with Tilke Engineers and F1’s own Motorsports Division, the circuit’s design has made strong use of the long, sweeping roads along the Corniche area, utilizing this feature and existing roads as much as possible, resulting in one of the most challenging circuits to feature in Formula One. The circuit includes a record number of corners (27 in total: 16 left and 11 right), in addition to three potential high-speed DRS sections and a 12-degree banked corner at Turn 13. The race will be staged under lights at night, setting the stage for a special atmosphere in Jeddah when the pinnacle of motorsport arrives in Saudi Arabia. With the countdown now on until the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, here is list of key facts and figures that relate to the Jeddah Corniche Circuit
