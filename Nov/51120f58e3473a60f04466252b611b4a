RIYADH: Saudi Arabia welcomed on Sunday a political deal signed between Sudan’s military and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The Kingdom’s foreign ministry said that it welcomed the agreement “regarding the tasks of the next phase, the restoration of transitional institutions leading to elections on time, and the formation of a competent government to push the transitional process forward and contribute to achieving the aspirations of the Sudanese people.” The ministry reaffirmed the Kingdom's support for everything that would achieve peace and maintain security, stability and development in Sudan. The 14-point deal signed by Hamdok and the military on Sunday officially restores the transition to civilian rule that had been derailed by the October 25 coup in the country. The agreement declared that General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan’s decision “to relieve the transitional prime minister (of his duties) is cancelled” and that all political detainees be freed. Egypt and the Arab League also welcomed the agreement.
