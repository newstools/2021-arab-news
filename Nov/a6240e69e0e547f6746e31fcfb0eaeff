LONDON: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his “deep concern” about two staff members being held by the Houthis in Sanaa on Wednesday. One of the Yemeni men detained by the Houthis works for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the other works for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Both men are being held without charges and prevented from contacting their families, the secretary-general’s spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Guterres said the UN had received assurances from the Houthis, prior to last week's Security Council meeting on Yemen, that the staff would be released. However, they are still being detained. “We don't understand why they have been detained and why are they not being released,” Dujarric said. He called on the Houthis to immediately release the UN employees. The secretary-general also condemned the summary execution of 10 individuals belonging to local security forces that took place in Hodeidah governorate on Nov. 13. “These amount to serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law which must be promptly and thoroughly investigated and perpetrators brought to justice. We call again on all sides to fully adhere to international humanitarian and human rights law under all circumstances,” Dujarric said.
