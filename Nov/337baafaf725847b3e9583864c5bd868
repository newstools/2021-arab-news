Al-Rashid, director of Ithra. “It reflects our identity and culture, and deserves to be studied, preserved and presented for posterity,” he added in a released statement. Architects, designers, archaeologists, artists, writers, historians and curators will come together to explore the rich history of mosques through the presentation of original research and insight about mosque-related cultural objects as well as the display of a range of items, from architectural ornaments such as calligraphy and arabesque tiles to mosque furniture including lamps, prayer rugs and Qur’an stands. The goal of the conference is to “share knowledge and broaden people’s understanding of the mosque’s historical meaning, evolution and function,” per the press release. The event will explore the evolution and aesthetic of the mosque, the beauty and function of objects found in the place of worship and the preservation and revival of the mosque. The three-day conference will be held in conjunction with a coinciding exhibition titled “Shatr AlMasjid: The Art of Orientation,” which brings together the largest collection of Islamic artworks ever displayed in the Kingdom, including several pieces originally from the two holy mosques of Makkah and Madinah on loan from the National Museum of Riyadh.
