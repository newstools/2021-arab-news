DUBAI: The Arab coalition forces said more than 140 members of the Houthi militia were killed and 18 military vehicles were destroyed in Al-Bayda and Marib in Yemen, TV news channel Al-Arabiya reported Monday. The strikes came in support of Yemeni forces on the west coast, the coalition said, adding that the coalition air forces have carried 26 operations in both governorates during the past 24 hours. The coalition said it is supporting Yemeni forces on the west coast outside the framework of the Stockholm Agreement. The official spokesman for the coalition, Brigadier General Turki Al-Maliki, said on Monday that the redeployment of coalition and Yemeni forces to the western coast came within its military strategy of supporting the Yemeni government on all fronts, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. “The joint forces in the western coast carried out last Thursday the redeployment and repositioning of their military forces under the directives of the Joint Forces Command of the coalition, and the repositioning process was characterized by discipline and flexibility as planned and in line with the future plans of the coalition,” he said. Al-Maliki also said the Houthis still controlled three ports in the area (Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa), and were not enabling the UN to supervise the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. He added that Houthi violations of the agreement numbered more than 30,000, according to SPA. He urged the UN and its mission in Hodeidah to play its role in implementing the agreement, as well as calling on the international community to pressure the Houthi militia to fully comply and implement its provisions. Also on Monday, Saudi Arabian defenses said they intercepted a Houthi drone which had been launched toward Khamis Mushait.
