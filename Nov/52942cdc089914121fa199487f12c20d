DUBAI: Expo 2020 Dubai has recorded nearly 3 million visits since its opening on Oct. 1, according to a statement issued on Monday. Organizers reported 2,942,388 visits, of which 100,000 were schoolchildren, with more students expected to tour the Expo site during the Knowledge and Learning Week to be held from Dec. 12-18. Half-term and public holidays, such as the Prophet’s birthday on Oct. 21, also contributed to the event’s high visitor turnout. Since its opening Expo 2020 Dubai marked UAE Flag Day and hosted Diwali celebrations, which featured a strong entertainment line-up including India’s Salim and Sulaiman Merchant, and Bollywood playback singer Vipul Mehta. Meanwhile, visitors filled a temporary circuit at Expo 2020 Dubai as the world’s best cyclists contested Giro d’Italia Criterium – the first ever official sporting event to be staged at a World Expo. And coinciding with the Dubai Fitness Challenge, Usain Bolt – an 11-time world champion, eight-time Olympic gold medallist and holder of multiple world records – will also make an appearance at the Expo site on Nov. 13 and will be leading a family run. Expo 2020 Dubai, which runs until March 31 next year, will include performances by Nancy Ajram and Ragheb Alama at Al Wasl Plaza on Nov. 12. On the same day, KITE, a K-pop concert, will welcome acts including Highlight and Punch.
