A Chatila diamond necklace was also sold for $30,186 — more than triple its pre-sale estimate.   Hailed as the “first lady of Egyptian cinema,” Rostom was one of the most popular movie stars during the Golden Age of Arab cinema, starring in over 80 films.   Rostom was known for her passion for collecting jewelry, sourcing pieces from around the world through her favorite boutique in Cairo, as well as designing a number of signature pieces.   She was also a regular attendee at auctions, seeking out her favorite gemstones — diamonds and rubies — in the midst of eclectic antiques.
