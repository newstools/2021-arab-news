RIYADH: The Arab Coalition published details on Friday of an operation targeting Houthi military camps in the presidential palace in Yemen’s milita-held capital Sanaa, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. Satellite images showed the presidential palace and its link to a secret underground facility located south of the palace and linked to Jabal Al-Nahdain. The intelligence photos showed the aftermath of the airstrikes conducted by the Coalition’s planes as well as a transfer of weaponry from the secret facility after the coalition targeted it with strikes earlier this week. Also this week, the Coalition said it launched strikes on Houthi drone sites in the capital Sanaa, impacting the Iranian-backed milita’s missile capabilities. “We have taken preventative measures to spare civilians and civilian objects from collateral damage,” the statement carried by SPA said. “The operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and its customary rules.”
