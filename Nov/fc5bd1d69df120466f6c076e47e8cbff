DUBAI: Mediaquest, the content and marketing division of Akama Holding, has announced the promotion of Obeida Danhach to CEO, effective immediately. Prior to her new role, Danhach was the publisher in charge of Marie Claire’s regional editions, Haya, Buro 24/7 Middle East, and the Arab Luxury World conference, among other media brands. Danhach takes over from Alexandre Hawari, who relinquishes this position to focus on his role as CEO of Akama Holding. “Akama Holding, which creates, acquires, invests in and develops powerful media brands and tech companies, was built on Mediaquest, our foundation business. Seeing it transform so deeply is a great source of pride and I know that in Obeida’s hands, this new era will prove very successful,” said Hawari. Danhach has been with the company since 2007, working for nine years in business development roles and five years as a publisher. During this time, she has played a significant role in tripling the size of Mediaquest’s lifestyle portfolio and diversifying its revenue streams. Today, the media brands are leaders for the region’s female audience, with a combined reach of 2.6 million across print and digital platforms. Under her leadership, Mediaquest will accelerate its diversification and expansion process. As CEO, she will oversee Mediaquest’s move into its third decade, transforming it into a marketing services company focused on the female audience in the Middle East. Using the insights and relationships it has gained over the years, the company will reposition itself to provide data-driven, content, creative, tech, and consulting services to brands seeking to capitalize on this powerful audience. “The digital transformation of media doesn’t stop at the delivery of content online. That’s merely the beginning of a far longer and exciting new journey, powered by data, audience and market intelligence, technology, and our subject matter experts,” said Danhach.
