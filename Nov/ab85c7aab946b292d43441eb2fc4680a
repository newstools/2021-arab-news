RIYADH: The Arab coalition on Wednesday said it had targeted legitimate military sites in Yemen’s capital. The coalition said that a building under construction had been targeted because it was used for the manufacturing of explosive-laden drones. Drones remain the primary choice of weapon for the Iran-back Houthi militia for cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia. The coalition asked civilians in Sanaa not to gather around or approach the targeted sites.
