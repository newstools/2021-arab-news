JEDDAH: Three global alliances have applied to submit green hydrogen projects in Egyptian regions of Sukhna and East-Port Said, according to a statement by the Egyptian cabinet. The head of the Suez Canal Authority, Yahya Zaki, pointed out the possibility of implementing the three projects in parallel. Zaki's statements came during a meeting held by the Egyptian Prime Minister on Thursday, to review the settlement of the Suez Canal Economic Zone regarding the green hydrogen industry.
