DUBAI: COFE App, the online coffee-centric marketplace, has announced a regional partnership deal with MBC Group. The strategic partnership will see MBC Group extend its support to COFE in achieving its ambitious growth strategy through MBC’s channels, digital platforms and events. MBC Group will play a critical role in adding scale and visibility to COFE’s growth trajectory in addition to having investment priority in COFE App’s future funding rounds. COFE’s strategic collaboration with MBC Group marks the first in a series of key partnerships that will support the start-up in strengthening its footing in the beverage tech sector. The app, whose success was accelerated during and after the pandemic, currently serves coffee lovers across the UAE, KSA, and Kuwait. “This partnership marks a pivotal milestone for the COFE brand. We truly believe we can become a market leader in the beverage technology space across the region and beyond and can only reach our goal with the support of the vast network of channels and partners of the heavyweight MBC brand,” said Ali Al-Ebrahim, founder and CEO of COFE.
