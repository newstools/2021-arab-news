RIYADH: The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) announced the completion of the construction of Unit 3 of the Barakah nuclear energy plant, the Arab World’s first multi-unit operating nuclear energy plant located in the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi. The announcement was made on the sidelines of the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference during Energy Day. Unit 3 has been handed over for operational readiness activities and is on track to start up and deliver clean electricity in 2023. The Barakah plant will have cut Abu Dhabi Emirate’s carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2025. “With Unit 3 construction now complete, we are progressing smoothly towards supplying a quarter of the UAE’s electricity needs completely carbon free," Mohamed Al Hammadi, managing director and chief executive officer of ENEC, said.
