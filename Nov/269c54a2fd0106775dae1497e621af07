Britain's Rolls-Royce said its electric aircraft, ’Spirit of Innovation’, is the “world’s fastest all-electric vehicle,” setting three new world records. The British automaker said in a statement the aircraft had reached a maximum speed of 623 kilometers per hour (387.4 mph) during test runs at an experimental aircraft testing site. The figures have been sent to the World Air Sports Federation for verification. The ‘Spirit of Innovation’ is part of the Accelerating the Electrification of Flight’ project (ACCEL), with half of the project’s funding provided by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), in partnership with the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and Innovate UK. “Following the world’s focus on the need for action at COP26,  this is another milestone that will help make ‘jet zero’ a reality and supports our ambitions to deliver the technology breakthroughs society needs to decarbonise transport across air, land and sea,” Rolls-Royce CEO, Warren East, said.
