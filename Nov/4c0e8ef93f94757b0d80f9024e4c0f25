TOKYO: The Japanese government on Monday strongly condemned the attack that targeted Iraq’s Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, and said it considers it an act of terror that undermines democracy in Iraq. Kadhemi escaped unhurt when an explosives-packed drone struck his Baghdad residence early Sunday. “The Government of Japan will continue to support the efforts of the Iraqi government to ensure democracy, peace and stability in Iraq,” said an official statement issued by the foreign ministry in Tokyo.
