JEDDAH: Saudi Ministry of Culture on Thursday hosted the first Islamic Art Biennale at the Islamic Museum in Riyadh to mark UNESCO’s International Day of Islamic Art. The day aims to raise awareness about the art of Islam and its contribution to culture and civilization. The ministry is working with the Islamic World Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization to produce the Biennale. Islamic art is not restricted to religious art — it includes the art of the rich and varied cultures of Islamic societies throughout history. It is a complex art to define because it spans over 1,400 years, covering many lands and populations, and is not restricted to a single medium. Instead, Islamic art covers a range of artistic fields, including architecture, calligraphy, painting, glass, ceramics and textiles. Last year, Minister of Culture Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan designated 2021 as the Year of Arabic Calligraphy in appreciation of its importance in expressing the Arabic language's historic significance. The ministry has launched “The Calligrapher Platform,” an electronic platform to teach Arabic calligraphy and Islamic ornamentation with the support of the Quality of Life Program. Following the setting up of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation last year, the first Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale will host international artists from Dec. 11 to March 11 in Diriyah’s Jax neighborhood.
