DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s landmark pavilion at the Daubi Expo 2020 recorded one million visitors on Thursday since it opened on Oct. 1. The occasion was marked with a special ceremony in the Open Square area of the pavilion, a uniquely designed five-story structure that is the second largest pavilion at Expo. A special video and a countdown to the one million mark were shown on a giant digital screen, amid a shower of colorful confetti, followed by a traditional musical show performed by Saudi artists. The pavilion offers varied content anchored in its four core themes: People, Opportunity, Heritage, and Nature. “I extend a message of appreciation to all our visitors. I am very proud to see Saudi Arabia’s Pavilion attract so many visitors from around the world who have all come to experience the transformation of the Kingdom and learn about our country’s rich heritage, diverse people, vast opportunities, and natural wonders,” Hussain Hanbazazah, Commissioner General of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Pavilion, said. “We invite everyone who hasn’t had the chance to visit yet, to come and learn about the real, authentic Saudi Arabia – and I extend an open invitation to visit our country and experience our culture and hospitality firsthand,” he added. The pavilion showcases Saudi Arabia’s 13 regions through immersive and interactive exhibits on economy and investment, arts and culture, nature, energy, and more. Over Expo’s six-month course, taking place under the theme ‘Connecting Minds, Building the Future’, the Saudi pavilion is hosting thought leadership panels and symposiums on various topics, and cultural shows that include dance, poetry, art and music. Visitors can watch the traditional Saudi Ardah dancers as they deliver performances to the beat of folkloric drums and spoken poetry. Visitors can also sample traditional Saudi dishes from across the Kingdom’s 13 regions at Sard café.
