JEDDAH: The Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance, or Masam, dismantled 1,443 mines in Yemen during the first week of November. The figure comprised six antipersonnel mines, 520 anti-tank mines, 915 unexploded ordnances, and two explosive devices. Masam is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the directive of King Salman to help ease the suffering of people in Yemen. Saudi and international experts are removing mines planted by the Houthi militia in Marib, Aden, Al-Jawf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale, and Saada. A total of 286,080 mines have been cleared since the start of the project. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians. Masam has 32 de-mining teams to protect civilians and ensure that urgent humanitarian supplies are delivered safely. It trains local de-mining engineers, gives them modern equipment and helps mine victims. Most landmines retrieved by Masam teams are locally made, while others originate from Iran. Houthis are developing anti-vehicle mines and turning them into antipersonnel explosives to terrorize civilians.
