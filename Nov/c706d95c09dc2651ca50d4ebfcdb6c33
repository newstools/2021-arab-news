Meanwhile, The WHO warned on Monday that omicron variant of coronavirus carries a very high global risk of surges, as more countries reported cases, prompting border closures and reviving worries about the economic recovery from a two-year pandemic. Scientists have said it could take weeks to understand the severity of omicron, which was first identified in southern Africa. Its emergence has caused a strong global reaction, with countries imposing travel curbs and other restrictions, worried that it could spread fast even in vaccinated populations.
On Sunday, a South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a new strain said omicron appeared so far to be producing mild symptoms.
