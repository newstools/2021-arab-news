KHARTOUM: Qatar-based satellite news network Al-Jazeera said Sunday its bureau chief in Sudan was detained by security forces.
	The network said on Twitter that Sudanese forces raided the home of Al-Musallami Al-Kabbashi.
	The development comes a day after security forces fired live ammunition and tear gas to disperse protesters denouncing the military’s tightening grip on the country. At least five people were killed and several were wounded, according to activists.
	Al-Jazeera did not elaborate on Al-Kabbashi’s detention and Sudanese officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
