NAJRAN: Najran’s mud houses are found in more than 40 villages. They are characterized by architectural designs that, together with the palm trees and farms surrounding them, offer wonderful views.
	The houses express the heritage and aesthetic values of Najran architecture. Each structure is distinct and includes different features, either to beautify the building or to protect and preserve it.
	Some feature dakkah, a type of external couch attached to the house for the elderly. Others have kawa, a type of nook where residents keep books or lamps. Some rooms have safif, a type of shelf to place food on and to protect the house from salinity and water.
	Najran’s mud houses are built in various shapes. Some are high-rise rectangular structures, others are vertical with up to eight or nine rooms.
	The houses reflect architecture that is inspired by the natural landscape’s beauty.
