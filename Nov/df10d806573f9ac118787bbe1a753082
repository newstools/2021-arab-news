The St. Regis Riyadh and The Jeddah Edition are expected to open in prime city locations in 2022. The former is to be located at the entrance of the Diplomatic Quarter in Riyadh, while the latter is to be situated on the corniche of Jeddah. “The St. Regis Riyadh will be part of the ‘Via Riyadh’ which will be an ultra-luxurious zone of the Riyadh Season 2021, the six-month event that celebrates the city and its culture,” Sela Sport’s managing director, Rakan Al-Harthy, said. “While The Jeddah Edition will be perfectly located in the Jeddah Yacht Club and Marina, Jeddah’s most anticipated destination and will be part of the city’s vibrant celebrations and events during Jeddah Season,” he added. The signings show the growth of the tourism sector in the Kingdom, Chief Development Officer at Marriott International, Jerome Briet, said. “It also showcases the strong interest in our portfolio of sought-after luxury brands,” he added.
