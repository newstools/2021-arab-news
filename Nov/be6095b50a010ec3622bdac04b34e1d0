It is aimed at raising the readiness of tourism and environmental sites and initiating opportunities based on development in the Imam Abdulaziz bin Mohammed Royal Reserve Development Authority and the King Khalid Royal Reserve. Areas of Rawdat Khuraim and Thumama Park will also benefit from the memorandum of understanding.
