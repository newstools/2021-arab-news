ABU DHABI: The UAE Jiu-Jitsu Federation has attempted to set a new Guinness World Record for the largest training session. The bid took place across 14 different sites in the country in collaboration with Palms Sports and the Brazil pavilion at Expo 2020 and was aimed at highlighting the growing popularity of jiu-jitsu and the sport’s positive impact on society. The coordinated training sessions involved 2,700 athletes and were held simultaneously at locations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Al Ain. One of the sessions, staged at the Brazil pavilion, was attended by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, UAE Minister for Tolerance and Coexistence Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al-Nahyan, and the Brazilian Ambassador to the UAE Fernando Igreja. Bolsonaro’s visit on Monday to the jiu-jitsu lesson and part of the second day of the 13th edition of the Abu Dhabi World Professional Jiu-Jitsu Championship, coincided with Brazil’s Republic Day. Aside from the Expo venue, the other training sessions took place at nine schools in Abu Dhabi and four in Al Ain. On the Guinness World Record attempt, Igreja said: “This initiative contributes to the consolidation of relations between the people of the UAE and Brazil and the strengthening of bilateral cooperation in areas of common interest.” Mohammed Salem Al-Dhaheri, vice chairman of the UAEJJF, said: “We were proud to organize the training sessions in 14 different locations simultaneously. The session at Expo 2020 Dubai was the highlight, and we hosted it in collaboration with the Brazil pavilion to coincide with the country’s Republic Day. “In addition, we chose to organize the classes in 13 schools in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, based on our belief in the importance of promoting the sport among youth, who constitute the most important source of jiu-jitsu talent in the UAE.”
