DAMMAM: Saudi municipalities have ramped up efforts to monitor compliance with health and safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Eastern Province Municipality carried out 3,889 tours of commercial centers and facilities in one week, identifying 239 violations. Field teams closed five commercial outlets for breaching protocols. The violations included noncompliance with social distancing and mask wearing, leniency in measuring the temperature of customers, overcrowding issues and a failure to use the Tawakkalna app effectively. The app was launched last year to track COVID-19 cases and has been updated to show vaccination information, including an individual’s status, such as vaccinated or infected. It now functions as a COVID-19 “passport.” The municipality urged all commercial facilities to abide by regulations to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of the disease. Officials have also called on the public to report any suspected health breaches by phoning the 940 call center number or contacting authorities through the Balady app.
