RIYADH: Kitopi, the world’s leading managed cloud kitchen platform, has invested in multiple regional food and bevarage groups as part of its next phase of growth, according to a company statement. The Dubai-based company has begun initial investments in Cloud Restaurants (famous for Go! Greek and Go! Healthy), Leap Nation (famous for Tawook Nation and Luca), Right Bite, Under500, and Ichiban, a sushi delicacies chain.

The new strategy will allow brands to leverage Kitopi’s proprietary technology and infrastructure to grow at an accelerated pace while preserving the customer experience, it said.
