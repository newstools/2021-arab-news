CAIRO: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has urged the Paris Conference on Libya to take a “clear and unambiguous” position supporting “the exit of all forms of foreign military presence in Libya” within a “clear and binding timeframe.”
	He reiterated Egypt’s readiness to help Libya unify its state institutions and enable its people to determine their own future.
	El-Sisi warned parties inside and outside Libya against attempts to undermine progress toward these goals.
	He urged the Libyan people to “transcend your differences and resolve them to build your country with a free Libyan will,” adding that “you will find Egypt a support whenever you need it, in support of your security, your choices and your ambitions.”
	He also called for equitable distribution of wealth to achieve comprehensive development in all Libyan regions.
