JEDDAH: The organizers of the Formula 1 STC Saudi Arabian Grand Prix 2021 have announced the country’s first female racing driver, Reema Juffali, as a Race Ambassador for this weekend’s inaugural event in the Kingdom. The 29-year-old, who took part in the British F3 Championship this year, will play a key role representing the event across the course of the race week and Grand Prix weekend, to be held in Jeddah from Dec. 3-5. “It is an incredible honor for me to be named as an ambassador for Saudi Motorsport for the first ever Formula 1 race weekend in Saudi Arabia,” Juffali said. “Growing up in Jeddah, I walked the very same streets which will form the circuit that the world’s best drivers will now race on. It’s hard to over-state what a momentous occasion this is for the city.” In her home city, Juffali will take part in a number of milestone events both on and off the track in her capacity as an inspirational role model for the next generation of drivers from within the Kingdom and beyond. “I’m really looking forward to taking part in the activities over the race weekend and I hope that my story and journey can provide some inspiration to anyone thinking of following their dream,” she added. “I also hope that the arrival of F1 in Saudi Arabia will inspire more of the next generation to pursue a career in the sport and continue our country’s racing evolution.” Juffali’s activities will include becoming one of the first people to drive the track in a test lap, taking part in the shakedown of the iconic Williams FW07 historic Formula 1 car and demonstrating her driving credentials alongside fellow professional racers in the Saudi Supercar Club.
