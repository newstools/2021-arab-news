RIYADH: The Arab coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed a drone targeting Saudi Arabia's Abha airport on Saturday. The coalition said it is dealing with the source of the threat “to protect civilians from hostile attacks.” Earlier on Saturday, the coalition said that 157 Houthis had been killed in strikes on the Yemeni areas of Al-Bayda, Al-Jouf, and Sirwah. 14 military vehicles were also destroyed during the strikes that took place over the last 24 hours. The coalition has been reporting near-daily strikes over the past month against the Iran-backed Houthi militia.
