LONDON: US special envoy Robert Malley is traveling to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel and Bahrain for talks on Iran and its “destabilizing activities” in the region. They will also discuss the upcoming seventh round of talks on the Iran nuclear deal, the State Department said. On Wednesday, the US said Malley would be heading the US delegation to the talks which will resume on Nov. 29. The deal agreed in 2015 with world powers was designed to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions against the Islamic Republic. After Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018, Iran has increasingly breached the terms of the agreement, specifically on terms surrounding the enrichment of uranium.
