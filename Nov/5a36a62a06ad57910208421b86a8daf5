CAIRO: Egypt has welcomed the signing of a political agreement aimed at ending Sudan’s political crisis that has been ongoing since last month. The agreement was signed by Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, chairman of Sudan’s Transitional Sovereign Council, and Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok. It stipulates the release of all political detainees, the acceleration of the formation of transitional government institutions, and the reversal of Al-Burhan’s decision to relieve Hamdok of his position as prime minister. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry praised “the wisdom and responsibility” of the Sudanese parties in reaching the agreement. The ministry expressed hope that the agreement will represent a step toward achieving sustainable stability, development and prosperity in Sudan.
