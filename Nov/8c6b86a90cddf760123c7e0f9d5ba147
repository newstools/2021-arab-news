RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif met Bandar Mohammed Al-Atiyyah, Qatar’s ambassador to the Kingdom, in Riyadh on Monday. During the meeting, they discussed issues of common interest. On Sunday, Prince Abdulaziz said in Manama that security and stability in Gulf states set a good example for confronting terrorism, crime, and everything that disturbs the security and safety of citizens and residents. The minister compared the current situation — a product of regional assistant and support — with the previous deteriorating conditions of some countries that had lost the most basic elements of security and stability.
