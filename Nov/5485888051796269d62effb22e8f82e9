RIYADH: Foxconn’s Jusda unit is considering raising funds from private investors ahead of a potential initial public offering early next year, sources told Bloomberg. Foxconn’s supply chain management platform seeks to raise $300 million to $400 million in the so-called pre-IPO round, the sources said. The company will use the proceeds to expand logistics services, they said. Jusda is also in the early stages of evaluating a potential listing in Hong Kong in the second half of next year, the sources added. No final decision has been taken because the considerations are preliminary and details such as the size of the funding can still be changed, they said. Foxconn spokesman Jimmy Huang said Jusda has no plan for an IPO right now, and declined to comment on the fundraising.
