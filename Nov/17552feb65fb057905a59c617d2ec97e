RIYADH: Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, is testing a new subscription service that allows customers to trade cryptocurrency without paying a per-transaction fee, Bloomberg has reported. However, the charging structure would include customers paying so-called spread fees on cryptocurrency sales and purchases made through the service. “We are always looking to learn more about how we can best serve our customers in different ways, right now we are still in early stages so everything about the future product experience will be shaped by the feedback we receive from our users,” Coinbase said in a statement. Coinbase will report its quarterly results on Nov. 9. Analysts are expecting a double-digit sequential decline in third quarter revenue, due to a decline in trading volume and active users in the wake of a second quarter slump in Bitcoin that likely weighed on investor optimism early in the third quarter.
