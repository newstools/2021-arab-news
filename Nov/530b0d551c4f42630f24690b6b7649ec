DAMMAM: Saudi municipalities have ramped up efforts to monitor compliance with health and safety measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease. The municipality of Eastern Province carried out 8,869 inspection tours of commercial centers and facilities in one week, identifying 528 violations. Field teams closed 15 commercial outlets for breaching protocols. The violations included noncompliance with social distancing and mask-wearing, leniency in measuring the temperature of customers, overcrowding issues, and a failure to effectively use the Tawakkalna app. The app was launched last year to track COVID-19 cases and has been updated to show vaccination information, including an individual’s status, such as vaccinated or infected. It now functions as a COVID-19 “passport.” The municipality urged all commercial facilities to abide by regulations to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of the disease. Officials have also called on the public to report any suspected health breaches by phoning the 940 call center number or contacting authorities through the Balady app.
