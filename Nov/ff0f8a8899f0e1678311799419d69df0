CAIRO: Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan met with a delegation of the Arab League, state television reported on Sunday.
	Sudan state TV gave no further details. Later on Sunday, an Arab League delegation met ousted Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok for “lengthy talks” on challenges facing the transitional process and efforts to support dialogue, the regional organisation said in a statement.
	The Arab League, which has called for Sudanese parties to stick to the democratic transition after the army took over power last month, had said on Saturday that it would send a high-level delegation to Sudan.
