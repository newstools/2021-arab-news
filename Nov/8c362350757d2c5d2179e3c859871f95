RIYADH: Dogecoin has overtaken Bitcoin in popularity in the US as it is the most searched cryptocurrency in the country’s 23 states, according to a research. The research was conducted by the financial adviser The Advisor Coach to establish the cryptocurrency that each state wants to invest in based on searches. Analysis of the Google Trends data revealed that Dogecoin had the highest number of states wanting to invest in the cryptocoin with a total of 23 states, including Illinois, Florida, Hawaii and New Jersey. The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept Dogecoin as a form of payment.

Bitcoin was the second most popular with 10 states searching to invest in Bitcoin more than any other cryptocurrency, including Connecticut, Alaska, Mississippi, and New Hampshire.
