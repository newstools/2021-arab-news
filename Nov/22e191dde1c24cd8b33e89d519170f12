RIYADH: Authorities in Saudi Arabia said on Thursday they foiled an attempt to smuggle a large quantity of khat into the Kingdom.
	Border Guards spokesman Lt. Col. Misfer Al-Quraini said that as part of ongoing operations to combat drug smuggling in the the Kingdom, land patrols from the Damad Center in the Al-Dair sector in Jazan were able to thwart an attempt to smuggle 825 kilograms of the narcotic substance.
	Al-Quraini said the khat was hidden in a water tanker that was being driven by a Yemeni national, who was violating the the border security system.
	He added that legal procedures have been completed, and the khat was seized and handed over to the concerned authority. جانب من عملية إحباط محاولة تهريب (825) كيلو جرامًا من القات المخدر بحوزة مخالف لنظام أمن الحدود من الجنسية اليمنية.#حرس_الحدود_السعودي pic.twitter.com/lhGpRqNuGm — حرس الحدود السعودي (@BG994) November 4, 2021
