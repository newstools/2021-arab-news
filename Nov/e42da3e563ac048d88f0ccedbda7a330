RIYADH: The Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance dismantled 1,401 mines in Yemen during the third week of November. The figure comprised five antipersonnel mines, 600 anti-tank mines, 793 unexploded ordinances and three explosive devices.
	The project is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the directive of King Salman to help ease people’s suffering in Yemen.
	Saudi and international experts are removing mines planted by the Houthi militia in Marib, Aden, Al-Jawf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale, and Saada.
	A total of 289,046 mines have been cleared since the start of the project. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians.
	The project has 32 de-mining teams to protect civilians and ensure that urgent humanitarian supplies are delivered safely. It trains local de-mining engineers, gives them modern equipment and helps mine victims.
	Most landmines retrieved by the teams are locally made, while others originate from Iran. Houthis are developing anti-vehicle mines and turning them into antipersonnel explosives to terrorize civilians.
