RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s air defenses intercepted and destroyed two explosive-laden drones launched by Yemen’s Houthi militia toward the Kingdom’s southwestern region, state TV reported on Tuesday, citing the Arab coalition.
	The coalition said both drones were targeting the city of Jazan.
	The Iran-backed Houthis routinely launch cross-border attacks targeting populated areas and vital installations in southwestern Saudi Arabia, most of which are intercepted by the Arab coalition.
