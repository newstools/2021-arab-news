JEDDAH: A Saudi government fund has helped get more than 120,000 women into jobs in the private sector since the beginning of the year, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The Human Resources Development Fund (Hadaf) also supported 80,000 men to find work in the commercial world. The Kingdom established reforms dedicated to the promotion of women’s engagement in economic development by preventing gender discrimination in terms of wages, occupation, work field and hours, according to the Unified National Program. The rate of women’s participation in the labor market doubled from 17 to 32 percent by the end of 2020, exceeding the Vision 2030’s goal to reach 30 percent, according to the ministry of human resource and social development.
