ROME: The Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Arab Parliament have pledged to work to strengthen Italian-Arab parliamentary relations, and will organize a forum for parliamentary diplomacy. Adel bin Abdul Rahman Al-Asoomi, president of the Arab Parliament — the legislative body of the Arab League — met in Rome with Roberto Fico, the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament. “We discussed the relationship between the Italian and the Arab Parliament, as we both believe that Italian-Arab parliamentary relations need to be increased,” Al-Asoomi told Arab News, adding that both sides pledged to “try to start a common workshop.” He said: “Italy already supports many Arab issues. We’ll soon launch initiatives that will strengthen and deepen Italian-Arab parliamentary relations, which in the past were quite weak. After this meeting, we realized we have so many points of view in common and we have a common job to do.” Fico and Al-Asoomi agreed to begin coordination of parliamentary relations between Italy and Arab countries. “While between Italy and the Arab world there are already very strong cultural and economic relations, parliamentary ties aren’t as strong,” said Al-Asoomi. “For this reason … we’ve decided to boost our common work to increase the common good for both parties.” An Italian-Arab forum for parliamentary diplomacy is in the pipeline, though no date has yet been agreed for this. Regular meetings will be held between the two parliaments. “I can honestly say I’m very satisfied because from now on there will be stronger relationships between us,” said Al-Asoomi. “We’ll take tangible steps toward initiatives for the good of Italy and the Arab world.” Fico said they also discussed developments in Libya and Palestine.
