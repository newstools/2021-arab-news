TOKYO: The Sudanese community in Japan held a protest condemning the military and its coup and called on countries not to fund arms to the Sudanese military government. Demonstrators, who gathered outside the United Nations University in Tokyo, offered support to the ongoing revolution and demanded a return to civilian power. They also sang revolutionary songs and chanted slogans. Two of the organizers read a statement addressed to the Head of the United Nations Delegation to Japan. The statements said the following: “The Sudanese Community and people in Japan strongly and with the harshest words, condemn the dreadful conduct of the Transitional Military Council in the form of a coup against the civilian government, alongside the unjust arrests of ministers and civilian activists, in addition to the massacres against our brothers and sisters – the protesters. We condemn the severe violence against the peaceful protestors, which in just two days resulted in six martyrs and hundreds of seriously injured people.” “Therefore, we appeal to you to stand with our unarmed and peaceful people by investigating the situation via your observing commissioners, and to appeal to all countries of the world not to cooperate with any government to be formed by the military without the consent of the national parties and stakeholders.” They presented a list of demands, which included the immediate release of the detainees; the immediate restoration of internet services; and the suspension of all army members, the Janjaweed, and police who participated in the killings at the end of October. The demonstrators also demanded the impeachment of Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Deglou; security and military reforms under supervision of the international community; and the civilian government regaining control of foreign affairs.
