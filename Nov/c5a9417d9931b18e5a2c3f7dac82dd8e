Jabal Ikmah, or the “open library,” as it is referred to by AlUla locals, is one of the many treasures that the land hides among its rocky formations.
	The mountain opening is located in the ancient city of Dadan. After a short hike, an opening welcomes visitors. At first glance, it may seem like just another crevasse among the mountains, but upon further observation, one can see that the rock face is filled with inscriptions.
	There are 450 inscriptions in languages that were used by locals before Arabic, making it a site of interest for archaeologists and historians who study the history of the region.
	The inscriptions are written in languages including Aramaic, Dadanitic, Thamudic, Minaic and Nabataean.
	Some of the writings are estimated to be from the first millennium B.C. Many are presumed to be names, while others are likely to be written records of events and religious beliefs. Signs of the earliest forms of Arabic can also be found in the mountains. The location is included as an official section of the AlUla tour, letting visitors experience the rich local heritage.
