RIYADH: The Arab coalition on Friday said it had shot down a Houthi missile targeting Jazan, in southern Saudi Arabia. The coalition said that it had detected suspicious activities at Sanaa International Airport, adding that it had now become a launchpad for hostile acts against the Kingdom from Yemen. The coalition on Thursday destroyed a number of sites in Yemen, including a hideout of experts belonging to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia is targeted by the Iran-backed militia nearly daily using explosive drones, which are often easily destroyed by the Kingdom’s air defenses.
