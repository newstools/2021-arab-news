TOKYO: Japanese media said Iran was behind the failed assassination attempt of the Iraqi Prime Minister at dawn on Sunday. “Iraqi security officials said some armed pro-Iranian groups in Iraq carried out the failed assassination attempt,” the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said, quoting Reuters. The paper said that in Iraq, a coalition of pro-Iran political parties was defeated in the parliamentary elections in October, “which may have led to this incident. Supporters of those political parties accused the Al-Kadhimi government of rigging the elections,” the Mainichi said. “This attempt aimed to intimidate other forces and preserve political power.” The Japanese paper also said that the incident was carried out by the most powerful anti-American militant group, “Hezbollah Brigades,” and that the drones used in the crime are similar to those manufactured in Iran. The Mainichi further reported the commander of the “Quds Force” of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Esmail Qaani, entered Iraq on Nov. 7 and asked the leaders of pro-Iranian organizations to carry out the operation. A report from the Istanbul correspondent of Kyodo News, also quoting Reuters, said: “An Iranian-backed militia was reported to be involved in the attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Al-Kadhimi in Baghdad.” Kyodo’s report warned of escalating tension in the region and referred to the “alleged involvement of the Hezbollah Brigades militia, in cooperation with the Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq militia” in carrying out the operation. JIJI Press, meanwhile, quoted a Reuters report that “three drones were used to attack Al-Kadhimi's residence, two of which were intercepted, but the third exploded in the building. Al-Kadhimi was not hurt, but one of his guards was wounded.” This story was originally published in Japanese on Arab News Japan
