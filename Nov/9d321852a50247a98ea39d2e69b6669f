RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Friday welcomed the UN Security Council’s decision to blacklist three Houthi leaders for threatening the peace, security, and stability of Yemen. The council has subjected the leaders to a global asset freeze and travel ban and a targeted arms embargo. Council members agreed by consensus on Tuesday to impose sanctions on the Houthi head of the general staff leading the militia’s Marib offensive, Muhammad Abd Al-Karim Al-Ghamari; a leader of Houthi forces assigned to the Marib advance, Yusuf Al-Madani; and the Houthi's assistant defense minister for logistics, Saleh Mesfer Saleh Al-Shaer. The Kingdom’s foreign ministry expressed hope that the blacklisting would contribute to putting an end to the activities of the Houthi militia and its supporters. The ministry also hoped the decision would neutralize the danger posed by the militia, and stop it from being supplied with missiles, drones, weapons, and funds “to finance its war effort targeting civilians and economic facilities in the Kingdom” and Yemen and threatening international navigation and neighboring countries. The ministry reiterated the Kingdom's continued support for Yemen and its legitimate government, and all international efforts to reach a comprehensive political solution to end the crisis in Yemen and alleviate the suffering of its people.
