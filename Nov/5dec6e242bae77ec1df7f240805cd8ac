WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday spoke with Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and military leader General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, the State Department said, after the military reinstated Hamdok on Sunday following last month’s coup.
	Blinken told Sudanese leaders in calls that the country needs to make more progress on democracy before Washington resumes $700 million in suspended aid.
	“We must continue to see progress, we must continue to see Sudan move back down the democratic path, and that starts with the reinstitution of the Prime Minister but it certainly doesn’t end there,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
	“This is the first step. It’s not the last step,” Price added.
	He said there was no resumption of assistance, adding, “These decisions will be predicated entirely on what happens in the coming hours and the coming days and the coming weeks.”(With Reuters and AFP)
