The global mining company, Rio Tinto, plans to invest $87 million to increase aluminum production in North America, with 16 new smelting cells at its AP60 smelter, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, the company said in a statement. This happens amid the global trend to reduce climate change, as demand from electric cars, solar panels and recyclable packaging grows. The company will increase production at the smelter by 45 percent, reaching a capacity of 86,500 metric tonnes and employing around 100 employees at the facility. "Our AP60 technology is one of the most energy efficient, environmentally friendly and cost effective systems in commercial production today. It produces some of the world’s lowest carbon aluminium with renewable hydropower here in Quebec,” the company's chief executive, Ivan Vella said. “We are assessing options for further investments, as we progress development of the ELYSIS™ zero carbon smelting technology with our partners,” he added. Rio Tinto, the second largest aluminum producer outside China, expects the global aluminum market to grow at an average rate of 3.3 percent annually over the next decade.
