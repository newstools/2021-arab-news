LONDON: An autistic man who wore T-shirts supporting banned Palestinian militant groups in a heavily Jewish area of London has admitted to carrying out terrorism offenses. Feras Al-Jayoosi, 34, pleaded guilty to four counts of wearing an article supporting a proscribed organization in a London court on Friday. The charges relate to him wearing shirts supporting Hamas’ military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigade, and Islamic Jihad. Three of the charges relate to his wearing the garments in Golders Green, an area of London with a concentrated Jewish population, in June this year. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring adjourned sentencing until Dec. 17, saying: “These are difficult cases to sentence. There is a fine line between support for a legitimate cause and support for a proscribed organization, and you have entered your pleas on that basis.” Al-Jayoosi has been released on bail.
