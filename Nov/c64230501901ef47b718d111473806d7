DUBAI: Spotify is available to listeners and creators in Iraq and Libya, as part of its ongoing commitment to be the top global audio streaming subscription service. In 2018, Spotify launched in 13 new markets in the MENA region with a fully Arabic user experience. These were the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, and Egypt. “Since the end of 2018, Spotify has already had a warm welcome in the region, and expanding our presence to Iraq and Libya will help us further support local artists and foster the local music scene,” said Claudius Boller, managing director of Spotify MENA. Listeners in the two countries will now have access to Spotify’s free and premium services, while local artists in these countries will have the same opportunities as creators in other markets, with the tools to gain more audience insights and propel their careers locally and internationally. Earlier this year, Spotify announced its expansion to more than 80 new markets around the world. “Building off the momentum from our expansion around the world in February of 2021, we’re excited to continue reaching new listeners and creators, regardless of where they live,” added Boller.
