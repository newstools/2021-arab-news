JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia on Wednesday recorded 38 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total for the country to 549,060, the Ministry of Health said. Another 59 people were reported as having recovered from COVID-19, putting the number of recoveries since the start of the pandemic at 538,049. However, one COVID-19-related death was logged in the past 24 hours, meaning 8,807 people in the Kingdom have now died after contracting the virus. More than 46.5 million doses of vaccine have now been administered in the country. The ministry, which has 587 centers throughout the Kingdom dealing with inoculations, has urged citizens who have not yet received a vaccine to get one. It also renewed calls for people to adhere to precautionary measures and register with the Sehhaty app to receive vaccines. Meanwhile, testing hubs and treatment centers set up throughout the country have helped millions of people since the pandemic outbreak. Taakad centers provide COVID-19 testing for those who show no or only mild symptoms or believe they have come into contact with an infected individual, while Tetamman clinics offer treatment and advice to those with virus symptoms such as fever, loss of taste and smell, and breathing difficulties. Appointments for both services can be made via the ministry’s Sehhaty app.
