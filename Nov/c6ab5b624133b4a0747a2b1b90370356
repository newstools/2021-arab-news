LONDON: The Committee to Protect Journalists on Monday condemned Iranian authorities for imprisoning journalist Manoochehr Aghaei, and called for his immediate and unconditional release. Aghaei is the editor-in-chief of the independent, social media-based news outlet MiandoabPress and a reporter for the state-run news website Young Journalists’ Club. On Oct. 27, Aghaei presented himself to authorities at Miandoab Central Prison in West Azerbaijan province, to begin an eight-month prison sentence. His conviction reportedly stemmed from comments on MiandoabPress’s social media accounts, which were considered by authorities to be anti-state propaganda. “Iranian authorities must release reporter Manoochehr Aghaei immediately and unconditionally, and stop jailing journalists in connection with their work,” said Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa program coordinator at CPJ. “Authorities need to recognize that not every piece of journalism or commentary is anti-state propaganda, and must cease their brutal censorship of the press.” On the day of his imprisonment, Aghaei tweeted that he had been convicted of “spreading propaganda against the system.” The tweet, however, did not specify when he was charged or tried. “I have to present myself to judicial officials to start serving my sentence only due to people’s comments. Pressuring journalists is not the solution to the problems,” he added.
