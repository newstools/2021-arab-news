Paris, France: Google and Agence France-Presse on Wednesday said they had signed a “pioneering” five-year deal under which the world’s biggest Internet search company will pay an undisclosed sum for content in Europe.
	The agreement following 18 months of negotiations is the first by a news agency under the 2019 European directive on so-called neighboring rights, which are at the heart of multiple disputes between web giants and the media.
