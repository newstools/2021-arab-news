The Communications and Information Technology Commission signed a memorandum of understanding with the Human Resources Development Fund to provide financial support to Saudi delivery agents, a statement revealed. The financial support will be provided to those working in applications registered with the authority and for those who obtained a self-employment document from the ministry of human resources. The commission reported that the total amount reaches SR3,000 ($800) per month for each applicant, to be provided after executing a specific number of delivery requests. This aims to encourage Saudi youth to diversify sources of income and to keep up with the growth in delivery application.
