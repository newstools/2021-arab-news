ADEN: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center has launched the second phase of a project to enhance school health services for students and teaching staff in four Yemeni governorates. The project is being completed in coordination with the Ministry of Health and school health administrations within the Ministry of Education. It will last for five months and cover more than 35 districts in the governorates of Aden, Marib, Taiz and Hadramout to deliver services to more than 250,000 beneficiaries through 40 mobile medical teams. Each team will conduct periodic visits to targeted public elementary schools with the aim of increasing the level of public health for students and preventing the spread of disease in communities. Teams will include a general practitioner, nurse, community health specialist and psychiatrist, who will each conduct preliminary health checks on students before offering treatment against communicable and infectious diseases. The project will also deliver public health awareness services for students and educational staff on hygiene and public health procedures, the prevention of malnutrition and controlling contagious diseases. Psychological and social support services will also be offered to students through group sessions and activities. It comes as an extension of the project’s first phase, which began in November 2020. It lasted for six months and covered schools in Aden, benefiting about 44,000 students and educational staff. Ministry of Health Undersecretary for the Planning and Health Development Sector Dr. Ahmad Al-Kamal urged the importance of supporting the health sector and providing a safe, healthy environment to ensure the sustainability of Yemen’s education sector. He praised the efforts of KSrelief in improving the quality of medical and educational services.
