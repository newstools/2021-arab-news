KHARTOUM: Sudanese security forces fired tear gas Thursday morning at dozens of protesters manning barricades in the capital Khartoum, a witness said.
	Police have remained deployed in large numbers in north Khartoum where demonstrators kept up their protests through the night, witnesses said.
	Wednesday saw the deadliest crackdown on anti-coup protests since last month’s military takeover.
	At least 15 demonstrators were killed in Wednesday’s protests, most of them in north Khartoum, medics said.
