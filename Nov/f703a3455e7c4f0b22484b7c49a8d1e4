GLASGOW: UK prime minister Boris Johnson said global leaders were "in roughly the same position" as James Bond as he opened the leaders summit section of the UN Cop26 in Glasgow. Johnson said that James Bond "generally comes to the climax of his highly lucrative films strapped to a doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off, while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it". He added: "We are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today - except that the tragedy is this is not a movie and the doomsday device is real.The clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and furnaces and engines with which we are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster.” Johnson continued: Johnson has urged world leaders not to "fluff our lines", warning that younger generations will "not forgive us". He said: "Because if we fail, they will not forgive us - they will know that Glasgow was the historic turning point when history failed to turn. They will judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today and they will be right. Cop26 will not and cannot be the end of the story on climate change."
