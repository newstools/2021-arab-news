RIYADH: French President Emmanuel Macron will go on an official trip to the Gulf region, visiting Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar between Dec. 3 and 4, the Elysee presidential office said on Friday. France maintains strong relations with the Gulf States, in economic and cultural terms, but also in terms of security. Macron held talks on Friday with Pope Francis in the Vatican, along with top Vatican diplomats afterwards, where discussions included climate change, Lebanon, the Middle East, Africa, and the forthcoming French Presidency of the European Union.
