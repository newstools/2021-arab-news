Meanwhile, Saudia inaugurated the latest and largest Al-Fursan lounges in the global SkyTeam alliance at the international departure hall at King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah.
Ibrahim Al-Omar, the airline’s director general, said the lounges are part of its plans to improve the travel experience, adding that the Kingdom is witnessing a qualitative leap, in terms of hosting and organizing many international events, most prominently in Jeddah with the Red Sea International Film Festival and Formula 1, which will lead to an increase in visitors from around the world.
He added “the national carrier is not concerned only with transporting passengers, but also with developing a package of services, and the Al-Fursan Lounge is certainly among these services.”
The new hall covers an area of 3,500 square meters and accommodates about 10,000 guests per day. It includes a business center and is equipped with the latest and most luxurious facilities, in addition to a relaxation area, children’s corner and a dining area.
