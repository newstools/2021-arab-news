JEDDAH: Zakaria Ahmad owns a digital design agency called Skil Studios focused on identity building, graphic designing, and social media content building. “We were working with another company but recently started our own business,” said Ahmad. The entrepreneur is grateful for the customers who trust them with the design and layout. Their services start with designing the identity that represents their clients, then services such as digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media content development are also offered. Sometimes the business also offers videography and photography services. The company’s founder said that most companies here focus more on quantity rather than quality. He said his company’s goal is to start an agency that cares about its clients and has their best interest in mind. “We appreciate art in everything,” Ahmad said. He believes marketing and identity building is an art and his company seeks to achieve the target with perfection. He said that they want to offer something new. Ahmad said his team does not believe in “copying and modifying already existing designs,” instead they want to introduce the latest global trends in the Middle East without compromising on their uniqueness. He admitted that the business faced quite a few challenges along the way, which is usual for a startup. “We were looking for talented people with a passion for designing and art to help us achieve our goals,” Ahmad said. Ahmad is most proud of his company’s identity and the trust that his team has built with clients due to their sincere efforts. He said members of the creative team ensure they understand the requirement of clients and deliver them whatever their demands are.
