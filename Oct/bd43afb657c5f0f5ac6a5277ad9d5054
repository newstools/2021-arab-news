LONDON: A boy, 16, has been charged with murder over the fatal stabbing of an 18-year-old Afghan refugee, Hazrat Wali, in London last week. The 16-year-old from Hammersmith and Fulham, London, appeared in court via video link from the young offender’s institution where he is being held. He confirmed his identity and was told that his plea hearing would be held on Jan. 11, 2022. Wali’s brother and foster mother attended the brief hearing on Tuesday. The youth defendant was remanded into custody until his next court appearance. Police are continuing to investigate the stabbing, which is said to have occurred when a fight broke out in a field near Wali’s college in west London. Wali was an Afghan refugee who came to Britain two years ago, according to the Evening Standard. An unnamed relative told the free London daily newspaper: “He came here to study, he was living all on his own in London. His immediate family are all back in Afghanistan. “I saw him in hospital. He had a fight is all that I had heard,” the relative added. Witnesses say a teacher from the school ran over to give the teenager CPR in an attempt to save his life. While he administered first aid, Wali is said to have told the teacher the identity of the person that stabbed him. Wali died in hospital soon after. Wali is believed to have been the 25th teenager murdered in London this year.
