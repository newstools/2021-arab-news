CAIRO: The Saudi Green Initiative launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was widely welcomed by world leaders and leading environmentalists.
	The SGI aims to eliminate 278 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up from a previous target of 130 million tons. The crown prince said the SGI initiative would involve investments of over SR700 billion ($190 billion) in that time period. In a video message played at the forum on Saturday, Prince Charles said: “We have already seen great progress, which Saudi and Middle East green initiatives will accelerate.” #SGIForum: Prince Charles says we have already seen great progress, which #Saudi and #MiddleEast green initiatives will accelerate@Gi_Saudi #SaudiGreenInitiativehttps://t.co/SKobOYeFcO pic.twitter.com/5OMifnIVp7 — Arab News (@arabnews) October 23, 2021 “We now have a dangerously narrow window of opportunity to accelerate climate change action,” the prince of Wales added. #SGIForum: Prince Charles says we now have dangerously narrow window of opportunity to accelerate climate change action@Gi_Saudi #SaudiGreenInitiativehttps://t.co/SKobOYeFcO pic.twitter.com/FE2StQ63U7 — Arab News (@arabnews) October 23, 2021 Boris Johnson tweeted: “Saudi Arabia’s landmark pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2060 is a major step forward.” Saudi Arabia's landmark pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2060 is a major step forward.
