WARSAW: Poland has 6,000 soldiers deployed along the border with Belarus to help stop an influx of migrants, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Tuesday.
	Thousands of migrants — most of them from the Middle East — have crossed or tried to cross over from Belarus into eastern EU states since the summer.
	The EU suspects this is an effort coordinated by the Belarusian regime in retaliation against EU sanctions and has called the use of migrants a “hybrid attack.”
	“Almost 6,000 soldiers from the 16th, 18th and 12th divisions are serving on the Polish-Belarusian border,” Blaszczak said on Twitter.
	“The soldiers provide support to border guards by protecting the country’s border and not allowing it to be illegally crossed,” he said.
	Border guards are reporting hundreds of attempted crossings every day and accuse Belarusian border guards of helping the migrants cross.
	The government has implemented a state of emergency which bans journalists and humanitarian workers from the area and is planning a border wall.
	Charities have criticized the government’s hard-line approach, particularly its pushback policy, and have warned of the growing danger for vulnerable migrants crossing through forests in the freezing cold.
