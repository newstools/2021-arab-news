RIYADH: Saudi Minister of Tourism Ahmed Al-Khateeb met Executive Director of the UN Human Settlements Program Maimunah Mohammed Sharif to discuss boosting quality of life in the Kingdom’s cities as part of Vision 2030.
	Cooperation between the Kingdom’s Quality of Life Program and the UN program was also discussed, especially governing standards for its application in the Middle East.
