DUBAI: As part of the Saudi Ministry of Interior’s pavilion at GITEX Technology Week 2021 in Dubai this week, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah showcased the state-of-the-art technologies it employs to deliver the services the Kingdom provides to pilgrims and other visitors.
	They include artificial intelligence technologies that are used as part of the ministry’s digital platform to help pilgrims.
	They access the platform using smart cards that contain key information, including the details of their visit and medical data. This is used to organize their journeys.
	The ministry’s aim in adopting the latest technology is to provide upgraded services and develop the work of the pilgrim-services system as a whole.
