CAIRO: After a six-year hiatus, EgyptAir has resumed flights between the cities of Sharm El-Sheikh and Luxor to encourage domestic tourism. The decision came after the ministers of aviation and tourism met to discuss ways to promote tourism in Egypt. Flights between the two cities were halted in 2015 after incoming tourism declined due to the downing of a Russian passenger plane over the Sinai Peninsula in October 2015, which killed 224 people on board. In April, Egypt and Russia agreed to resume full air traffic between the two countries’ airports after a six-year hiatus. The flight between Sharm El-Sheikh and Luxor is scheduled to operate once a week, and its frequency could increase if there is appropriate supply and demand. The flight was restarted at the request of the private tourism sector, the Egyptian Federation of Tourist Chambers, and the Chamber of Travel and Tourism Companies and Agencies.
