RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Wednesday drew 2-2 with Uzbekistan in the opening match of the qualifiers for the 2022 AFC U23 Asian Cup, a tournament that will also act as a qualification campaign for the Paris Olympics in 2024. The result of the match, however, will not affect the qualifiers as next year’s tournament is being held in Uzbekistan, meaning the hosts have already secured their spot. The young Falcons scored through Hamid Al-Ghamdi in the 40th minute, and Abdulmohsen Al-Qahtani two minutes into the second half, while the hosts twice equalized on 45 and 79 minutes. The Saudi team is playing in Group D alongside Uzbekistan, Kuwait — who will meet Saudi Arabia in the second round matches on Saturday — and Bangladesh, who they face on Nov. 2. The non-hosting trio will be vying for the two qualification spots for the 2022 AFC U23 Asian Cup which will take place from Jan. 6 to 24 next year.
