DUBAI: The private food and beverage sector in the UAE has played an important role in the country’s response to supply chain pressure during the pandemic, a minister said, highlighting its part in achieving bigger food security goals. “The UAE is putting efforts to transition into more sustainbale food systems. This is where [the private sector’s] role is so important,” Emirati Minister of Climate Change and Environment Mariam bint Al-Mheiri said. The minister said the government will work hand in hand with key players in the private sector to tackle issues including reducing food waste, creating healthier food options, and empowering local sources. The comments were made at the ongoing Future Food Forum held in Dubai, where top executives in the food and beverage sector are also participating. Al-Mheiri, whose ministry plays a key role in the UAE’s national food security agenda, said the Gulf country will focus on two major goals. “We want to be pioneering as a food hub for food trade, but we also want to be less dependent on net food imports,” she explained. At the same time, Al-Mheiri said the UAE also has ambitions to be a center for knowledge and innovation in food technology, particularly in growing food in hot and arid climates. The Future Food Forum will run until October 20 at the Dubai Exhibition Center within the World Expo site.
