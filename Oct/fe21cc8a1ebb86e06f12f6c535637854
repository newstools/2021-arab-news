RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Military Industries on Sunday announced the signing of a contract with the Saudi Arabian Military Industries for the development and manufacturing of the “SkyGuard” unmanned aerial vehicle. SAMI also signed an agreement with Prince Sultan Defense Studies and Science Research Center with the aim of further developing the UAV. “SkyGuard” is “the outcome of numerous research and development efforts, undertaken by the center and geared towards developing a truly local product,” it said, as the Kingdom plans to supply half of its military needs with products made at home. GAMI has identified 74 investment opportunities, across six domains of the military industries sector. The authority has launched a digital platform called the Military Industry Marketplace that links local industry projects with investors that are authorized and licensed by the authority. GAMI was established to grow the Kingdom’s military industries sector, in line with the Vision 2030 target of localizing more than 50 percent of defense expenditures by 2030.
