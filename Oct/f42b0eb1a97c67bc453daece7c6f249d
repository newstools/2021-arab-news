Riyadh: The value of sales across Saudi Arabia decreased by 5.2 percent in the week ending 16 October compared to the previous week, figures released by the Kingdom’s Central Bank (SAMA) revealed. Data showed that point-of-sale transactions fell back slightly to SR8.7 billion last week, from SR9.1 billion in the previous week. This decline was driven by a sharp fall in education sales, which were down by 25.8 percent. Sales of miscellaneous goods and services dropped by 9 percent while food and drink sales slipped by 7.9 percent. The hotel sector was the only one to record an increase in sales. They were up by 24 percent compared to a decline the week before.
