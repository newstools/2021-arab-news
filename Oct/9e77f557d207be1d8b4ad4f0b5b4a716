DUBAI: YouGov has released its 2021 Retail Rankings for Saudi Arabia. The brands on the list were ranked based on their index score, a measure of overall brand health calculated by taking the average of impression, quality, value, satisfaction, recommendation, and reputation over a period of 12 months. Jarir and Adidas emerged as the retail brands perceived as delivering the best against their promise on key brand health-related metrics, according to those surveyed in Saudi Arabia by YouGov.  With retail having pivoted to online channels due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, audiences have been growing in numbers drawn by the convenience, comfort, and speed offered by online shopping. As COVID-19-related health and safety restrictions have lifted, retailers have had to work harder and innovate through personalization and the use of technology in-store to succeed. In this year’s retailers category, the famous Saudi bookstore chain Jarir took top spot emerging as the healthiest brand with an index score of 35.4. The top 10 list was dominated by regional brands with the exception of IKEA, which came in second. Grocery chains Panda and Lulu Hypermarket ranked third and ninth, respectively, while Centrepoint, the region’s largest fashion retailer, was positioned in sixth.  The sports and apparel category rankings put Adidas at the top of the table. The brand’s 50th-anniversary collaboration with prominent women and its strong messaging around female empowerment may have resonated with the public, strengthening its position among consumers in the country, according to YouGov’s analysis. Nike, which has also pioneered female-centric efforts in the Kingdom, came second, followed by Skechers and Puma. Lululemon came 10th on the list with a score of 2.4.
