DUBAI: The UAE announced the withdrawal of its diplomats from Lebanon in solidarity with Saudi Arabia on Saturday. The country also banned its citizens from travelling to Lebanon after offensive comments by the country’s information minister sparked controversy. A video of George Kordahi saying that the Iran-aligned Houthis were defending themselves and calling the war in Yemen “futile” emerged on Tuesday. Kordahi also described the war as a Saudi “aggression.” The Emirati decision came in light of the unacceptable approach by some Lebanese officials towards Saudi Arabia, Emirates News Agency reported. On Friday, Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Lebanon for consultations and requested the departure of Lebanon's envoy to the Kingdom, giving him 48 hours to leave. A few hours later, Bahrain also gave the Lebanese ambassador to the country 48 hours to leave. Kuwait followed suit on Saturday and summoned its ambassador to Lebanon for consultations and requested the departure of Lebanon’s charge d’affaires within 48 hours. Kuwait said the decision came in response to “Lebanon’s insistence on making negative statements and its reluctance to handle unacceptable and condemnable positions against Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.” Qatar denounced Kordahi’s statements, a statement from the media office of the Qatari foreign ministry said on Saturday. Qatar also called on the Lebanese government to take urgent measures to rebuild bridges between “brotherly nations,” and dismissed Kordahi's comments as “irresponsible.”
