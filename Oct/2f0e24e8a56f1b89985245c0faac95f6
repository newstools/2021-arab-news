The global response to COVID-19 is a blueprint for how to tackle climate change, according to the head of UAE’s investment fund. Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO and managing director of the Mubadala Investment Company, believes the way the private and public sectors worked together to combat the pandemic shows cooperation on global issues is possible. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, he said: “We had a pandemic that started in January 2020 and within 12 months through PPP (public private partnerships) a global solution went to actual production. “That is a blueprint to show availability to deliver.” Referring to his own company’s actions, Mubarak said Mubadala has invested more than $2 billion over the last 16 years in renewable energy across 13 countries.
