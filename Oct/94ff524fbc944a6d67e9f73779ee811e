DUBAI: Emirati designer Yara bin Shakar made her return to the Arab Fashion Week calendar on Tuesday night, with a dynamic show in Dubai Design District. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Relaxed sleeveless cuts made up the bulk of the new collection, while the designer announced a collaboration with the Fashion Week partner GoDaddy as she launched an online store. Polish label Dorota Goldpoint opened its show with a classical violin performance before the runway was dominated by floral red prints inspired by the Polish culture. The collection featured mainly evening gowns with attention to simple cuts sans embroidery and embellishments.   Dubai-based label Autonomie, founded by Egyptian creative director Maha Ahmed, showed off its typically edgy ready-to-wear collection titled “Metanoia,” which refers to the act of reforming. The line was dominated by short dresses, oversized pants, cropped trousers, asymmetrical skirts and playful fabric styled with white sportswear socks and black pumps.   Meanwhile, French designer Victor Weinsanto showed off his Spring collection. Having worked at the elbow of Jean Paul Gaultier before launching his brand last year, Weinsanto showed off pretzel-shaped braids propped on headbands, kooky kougelhof handbags and shirt dresses with nipped waists and ballooning sleeves.   The last highlight of the day was New York-based British designer Christian Cowan. The collection was perfect for partying with its off-the-shoulder, skintight dresses, oversized rhinestones and slits galore.
