RIYADH: The head of the Future Investment Initiative Institute (FII) has said that the nonprofit foundation is now an international organization which is registered in the United States. Speaking in a press conference in Riyadh today, Richard Attias added there are plans to build offices in Asia soon. The chief executive officer pointed out that to build credibility, the organization must have sponsors. While they are a part of the organization now, he remarked that it was not easy to attract the likes of HSBC and Zoom. The FII's chief operating officer Rakan Tarabzoni also said the foundation is now independent from the PIF and is focusing on promoting thinking and investments in startups among other areas.
