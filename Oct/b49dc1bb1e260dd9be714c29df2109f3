RIYADH: Sport needs to be recognised as a key weapon in the fight against climate change, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States declared at the Saudi Green Initiative on Saturday. Speaking in Riyadh, Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud said implementing the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and supporting its signatories will promote sustainability. “The principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change can educate, inform and inspire our conduct, and our behaviour, and it can make it clear that sports will help lead this battle,” she said, adding: “And as a member of the Saudi Olympic family and also representing the International Olympic Committee. I'm proud that the sporting world has this opportunity to confront the climate crisis.” The ambassador went on to argue that climate change can only be tackled if millions of young people around the world are mobilized to take care not just of themselves, but the environment around them. #WATCH: Sport needs to be recognised as a key weapon in the fight against climate change, says #SaudiArabia’s ambassador to the #US Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud @rbalsaud | https://t.co/EIpxpViPQ7@Gi_Saudi#SaudiGreenInitiative pic.twitter.com/6S3ZsZ89nP — Arab News (@arabnews) October 23, 2021 “And that's what sports has always done, and at no time has that leadership been more important than now as we look to protect the future generations and protect our planet,” she said.
