Assets held by Saudi Arabia’s central bank (SAMA) increased month-on-month by SR18.24 billion ($4.86 billion) to reach SR1.891 trillion ($504.1 billion), the bank’s latest statistical report showed. This was accompanied by a monthly growth rate of 0.97 percent. Looking at the assets’ composition, the central bank’s deposits with banks abroad underwent the largest rise, increasing on a monthly basis by SR42.45 billion or 16.1 percent to SR306.54 billion. This might be because it offers higher earnings and is a more liquid asset compared to others. Other miscellaneous assets, on the other hand, fell considerably by SR20.15 billion. The central bank's net foreign assets also grew by SR41.09 billion month-on-month in September to reach SR1.68 trillion. This is a 2.5 percent jump from August's SR1.639 trillion, according to data published on SAMA's website on Thursday. In addition, when compared to the same month last year, the bank’s assets, in total, grew by SR68.36 billion or by 3.75 percent.
