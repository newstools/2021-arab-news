RIYADH: Finland’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Antti Rytovuori, met Eastern Province Gov. Prince Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz at the Eastern Province governorate in Dammam on Tuesday.
	“We discussed current and potential cooperation between the two countries in many fields such as health, education, renewable energy, circular economies, trade and investment,” the ambassador told Arab News on Wednesday.
	Rytovuori also briefed the governor on a recently signed contract between Finnish company Valoe Oyj and Saudi Arabia’s ICON Advanced Co Ltd. to establish a joint solar panel production venture in Dammam.
	As part of the deal, ICON will own 60 percent of the business and Valoe Oyj 40 percent. The joint venture will see the construction of a manufacturing plant that Valoe will engineer and build.
	Planned investment totals about 15 million euros ($17.5 million), including the solar module manufacturing plant, technology transfer, and training and initial operation, which will be delivered by the Finnish company.
	Rytovuori praised the “rapid and extensive improvements” that the Kingdom has made in conditions for external investment.
	The Kingdom and Finland in December last year stepped up joint efforts in infection prevention by signing a memorandum of understanding. The signing ceremony took place at the Finnish embassy in Riyadh.
	Knowledge-exchange links between the two countries are based on the Kingdoms’s vast patient safety experience in mass gatherings.
