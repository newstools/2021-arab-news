Chilly Peri is a Saudi family-based business that offers three main products — crunchy chili flakes, crispy onions, and spicy mango pickle — inspired by an Indian and Middle Eastern kitchen. The products are provided per order and are freshly made in big quantities.
	Many ordinary home dishes sometimes lack a missing element. Perhaps a sour, spicy, or crunchiness would make it better. Chilly Peri is the answer as it adds a little sparkle of the spicy, crunchy, sour chili flakes that elevates any dish.
	The freshly-dried chilies offer a strong, spicy aroma and are made for those who appreciate that spicy twist. The crunchy onion and chili flakes can also be used as a topping or garnish for sandwiches, sushi, or soups.
	The spice level of the chili flakes can be customized per customer as requests can be made for individuals, large parties, or an entire restaurant.
	Products can be shipped across the Kingdom and are also available through the website www.chillyperi.com For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle
