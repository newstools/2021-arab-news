DUBAI: Expo 2020 Dubai this week saw visit numbers edge closely to 1.5m for the first 24 days since it opened to the public on October 1. The organizers say the numbers were boosted by the program of musical and cultural events, as well as the long weekend marking the prophet’s birthday and the half-term school break. Since the opening there have been 1,471,314 visits to the site, with children making up about 25 percent of visits to the site over the half-term week, which featured  cricket coaching program by the sporting greats the Rajasthan Royals. There was also turn up and play football sessions hosted by coaches from Manchester City. The long weekend, marking the prophet’s birthday, saw large crowds visit the site – many drawn to performances by the likes of the Expo 2020 all-female Firdaus Orchestra and British singer-songwriter Sami Yusuf. And Iraqi megastar Kadim Al Sahir, one of the most successful Arab artists in history, kickstarted Expo 2020 Dubai’s spectacular Infinite Nights series.
