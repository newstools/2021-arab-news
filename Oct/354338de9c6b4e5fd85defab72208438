A million cruise ship passengers will visit Saudi Arabia by 2028 according to ambitious plans set out by the managing director of the country’s Cruise Saudi company. Fawaz Farooqui set out the goal during a session at the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, as he also claimed 50,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created by the industry by 2035. He also pledged that five cruise ports will operate in Saudi Arabia by 2025. Farooqui’s comments came just days after Cruise Saudi became a member of the World Travel & Tourism Council as the Kingdom continues its drive to diversify its economy away from oil as per the Vision 2030 agenda.
