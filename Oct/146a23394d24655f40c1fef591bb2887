Dubai: Around 80 percent of Expo buildings will remain once the showcase finishes in a bid to attract technology firms and new investment, a spokesperson for Dubai Expo 2020 told Asharq news. The World Expo began on October 1 and will run to the end of March next year. Organizers hope to attract 25 million visits over the course of the event, despite travel restrictions and other complexities posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Expo vice president of communications Mohammed Al-Ansari added that the pavilions of UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia are the most visited so far, although he expects other pavilions to catch up during the exhibition. Saudi Arabia’s pavilion has attracted over 200,000 visitors so far, state news agency SPA reported.
