LONDON: The UAE has an important role in supporting a Yemen-led and inclusive political settlement to the conflict, the UN’s envoy for the country said. “In that same spirit, progress in the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement would also contribute to strengthening political partnerships, supporting basic service delivery and stabilizing the economy,” Hans Grundberg added as he ended his visit to the UAE on Thursday. The envoy held meetings with senior Emirati officials and Yemenis from various political components and the private sector during the visit, his office said. He met with the diplomatic adviser to the UAE’s president Anwar Gargash and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Khalifa Shaheen. The diplomats discussed the latest developments in Yemen and ongoing UN efforts to resume a comprehensive and sustained political dialogue among Yemeni parties. Grundberg expressed his concern over the rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen, including intensification of the war, fragmentation of state institutions, the impact of the conflict on the economy, and delivery of basic services. “It is high time that progress be made toward immediate and longer term political, economic and security priorities in the best interest of Yemenis,” he said.
