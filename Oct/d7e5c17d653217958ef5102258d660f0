The Saudi minister of investment will stress the Kingdom's position as a major global investment destination during his visit to the US, according to the Saudi Press Agency. Khalid Al-Falih will meet a group of US officials on Wednesday to strengthen the existing strategic trade and investment partnership between the two countries, the agency reported. “We consider American investors to be our partners, and we hope that they will seize the tremendous opportunities that are presented in the transitional stage we are living in,” Al-Falih said in a statement. The trip follows the launch of the National Investment Strategy by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, last week. "The National Investment Strategy will bring about a fundamental change in the investment landscape in Saudi Arabia, which will provide unprecedented opportunities and advantages for investors,” the minister noted.
