RIYADH: Soudah Development, a Public Investment Fund company, on Saturday announced a new environmental initiative to plant more than 1 million trees across Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa by 2030. It was announced at the Green Saudi Initiative Forum. The landmark project will support the Saudi Green Initiative, which aims to plant 10 billion trees, reduce carbon emissions by 4 percent, and raise protected areas to more than 30 percent of the Kingdom’s total land area. Protecting and expanding vegetation cover is at the heart of Soudah Development’s sustainable development strategy to transform Soudah and parts of Rijal Almaa into a luxury mountain tourism destination set atop Saudi Arabia’s highest peak. Deploying best-in-class irrigation techniques, the initiative to plant more than 1 million trees by 2030 will restore forests across a 627 square km area, boost natural environments, enhance ecological balance, and support the reintroduction of local species of flora and fauna.
	Hussam Almadani, CEO of Soudah Development, said: “Investing in the country’s extraordinary natural resources has been a guiding principle since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched Soudah Development. We have assembled some of the world’s foremost sustainability leaders to support our goals as we deliver a new era of sustainable luxury tourism in Saudi Arabia.” He added: “We are extremely proud to announce our initiative to plant more than 1 million trees by 2030. It consolidates our efforts to promote world-class sustainable development and demonstrates the high standards we set for ourselves when it comes to promoting environmental leadership.” By adopting global best practices, renewable energy and latest advanced technologies, Soudah Development is working to reduce water and electricity consumption, divert waste away from landfill and achieve carbon neutrality.
