RIYADH: The Royal Commission for AlUla aims to reduce carbon emissions by 270 metric tons annually by adopting a circular carbon economy approach, said the commission’s CEO Amr AlMadani on Saturday. He was speaking at a session titled “Give to nature, Nature gives back: The business case for a circular economy” held on the sidelines of the Saudi Green Initiative Forum in Riyadh. AlMadani said: “If we look today at AlUla the culture, oases and its current state demonstrate clearly why a circular carbon economy and sustainable practices are must do today for this oasis to revive. “We are committed through our masterplan to free the Oasis (AlUla) from the negative effects.” Almadani said. He said the commission is already working on a solar and renewable energy complex, which would produce 500 MW in excess to support the growing power demand by 2035.  “We are also integrating with the national (power) grid to make sure that any generated excess energy that is sustainable (should) flow through the sustainable grid,” AlMadani said. The session was attended by Magdi Batato, executive vice president, head of operation, Nestle and Renat Heuberger, co-founder and CEO, South Pole.
