BEIRUT: Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Tuesday he hoped cabinet meetings would resume after a two-week hiatus since a row over the Beirut blast probe led some ministers to ask for his removal.
	Local media had said that Mikati would not ask for another meeting to convene before a framework agreement was reached.
