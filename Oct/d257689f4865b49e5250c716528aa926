RIYADH: Saudi Arabia supports all efforts aimed at achieving stability in Libya, the Kingdom’s foreign minister said on Thursday. During the Libya Stabilization Conference, Prince Faisal bin Farhan praised efforts made by the new unified authority in Libya to meet the aspirations and hopes of the Libyan people towards achieving a united and sovereign state that enjoys security, stability, and development. Prince Faisal added that the Kingdom’s participation in the conference is a continuation of its policy aimed at reaching solutions that are in the interest of the Arab community and benefit the peoples of the region and the world. “The Kingdom stresses the importance of concerted international efforts to combat terrorism and extremist militias so that Libya will not be a safe haven for these groups, through which they threaten the stability of this country and its regional and international surroundings,” the foreign minister said. “We hope that this conference and its results will be an enabling factor for the elected executive authority and the UN Support Mission in Libya to carry out their duties and responsibilities toward their urgent plans, foremost of which is the holding of fair and transparent national elections whose results serve the aspirations and hopes of the brotherly Libyan people,” Prince Faisal added. The conference ended with a communique stressing the need for confidence-building steps to enable fair, transparent and inclusive elections on Dec. 24, Libyan Foreign Minister Najla El-Mangoush said on Thursday.
