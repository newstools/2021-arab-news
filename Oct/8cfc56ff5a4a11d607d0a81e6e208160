Iraq will stop flaring associated gas by 2025, the country’s deputy prime minister announced at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit. Speaking in Riyadh on Monday, Ali Allawi admitted his country’s previous climate policies had not always been up to scratch, but recommitted Iraq to working towards a greener future. Flaring gas is the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction, and releases harmful emissions into the atmosphere. He also stated that Iraq has a plan to produce 12 gigawatt of power from solar sources over the next ten years. Addressing delegates at the summit, including US Climate Change Envoy John Kerry, Allawi said the world has “no choice but to work together in order to focus on this challenge and work together to create nature based solutions.”
