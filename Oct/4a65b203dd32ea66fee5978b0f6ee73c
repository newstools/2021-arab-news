RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s air defenses intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen towards the Kingdom, state TV reported on Wednesday.
	The Arab coalition said in a statement that the missile was targeting the southwestern city of Jazan.
	Nayef Al-Hajraf, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), condemned the Houthi militia’s “continued systematic and deliberate launching of missiles toward the Kingdom and targeting the safety of civilians and civilian facilities, in flagrant violation of international laws.”
	Al-Hajraf called on the international community to take immediate and decisive measures and stances to stop these aggressive acts, which target vital and civil installations and the Kingdom's security.
	Yousef Al-Othaimeen, secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), also strongly condemned the latest attempt by the Iranian-backed Houthis to target a populated area in Jazan, while praising the efficiency and skill of the Saudi air defenses, which were able to intercept and destroy the missile before it reached its target.
	He said the OIC “condemns the terrorist practices committed by the Houthi militia, and those who stand behind, finance and provide them with weapons,” adding that these acts are considered “war crimes.”
	Bahrain also issued a similar statement condemning the attack and called on the international community to condemn these ongoing Houthi violations.
	The GCC, OIC and Bahrain affirmed their full support for all the security measures the Kingdom takes to protect its citizens and residents and maintain its security, stability and territorial integrity.
