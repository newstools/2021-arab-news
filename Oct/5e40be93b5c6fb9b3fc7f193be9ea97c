KABUL: A grenade was thrown at a Taliban vehicle in the Afghan capital on Wednesday morning, wounding two fighters and four nearby school children, government officials said.
	“This morning a grenade was thrown at a mujahideen vehicle in Deh Mazang, wounding two mujahideen,” Taliban interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti said.
	Another official said: “Our initial information shows four school students wounded.”
	The explosion happened just before 8 a.m. (0330 GMT) during rush hour in the Deh Mazang district in the west of the capital, a witness said.
	“I was on my way to work, it was 7.55am and I heard this very big explosion on the road. I managed to escape,” said Amin Amani.
	“I saw a lot of smoke in the mirror of the car and I saw people running,” the 35-year-old translator said.
	Images shared on social media showed plumes of smoke and dust rising into the air on the streets of the capital.
