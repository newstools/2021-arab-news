Up next was Bobby Lashley and Goldberg in the “No Holds Barred” contest where pin falls could happen anywhere in the arena. Everywhere in the arena is exactly where these two battled it out as the two bulls pulled out all the stops for the bout and Goldberg scored the win. Goldberg unleashed his full power on Lashley, giving him no moment to grasp what was happening, as the much anticipated fight began. The victory for Goldberg will taste all the sweeter as he wanted revenge against Lashley for hurting his son in Summer Slam earlier this year. The finals of the “King of the Ring” proved to be a stellar match between Finn Balor and Xavier Woods, the crowd awed at the spectacle Balor and Woods put on. Chants, screams and applause filled the auditorium after Woods pinned Balor in what was a lengthy and worthy match-up between the two warriors, in which Woods was crowned the winner. #ICYMI - #WATCH: @KSAMANNY with #SaudiArabia's @Olympics hero Tarek Hamdi during #WWECrownJewel @WWE #RiyadhSeason @RiyadhSeason @GEA_SA https://t.co/UO0jZWnLfx pic.twitter.com/XNKgze9RMZ — Arab News (@arabnews) October 21, 2021 Elsewhere, Big E retained the championship against Drew McIntrye in one of the nine major matches.

Free agent Brock Lesnar, the Beast Incarnate, faced the tribal chief Roman Reigns in the main event of the evening and the most anticipated fight yet.
