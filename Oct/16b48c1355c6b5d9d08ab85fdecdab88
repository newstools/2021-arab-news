CAIRO: Egypt has received 3.6 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from the US as part of Cairo’s plan to diversify and expand the provision of vaccines to citizens, said Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, acting minister of health and population. Egypt has so far received a total of 8.2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, he added. Khaled Megahed, spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population, said the latest batch will be analyzed by the Egyptian Medicines Authority before being distributed to vaccination centers nationwide. A source at the ministry said 25 million citizens have now been inoculated, and there are directives to expand vaccination facilities. The US Embassy in Cairo said the American people and government “are working with Egypt side by side” to fight the pandemic.
