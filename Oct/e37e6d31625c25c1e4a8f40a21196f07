France expressed “great concern” on Wednesday after a ballistic missile fire test conducted on Tuesday by North Korea landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. France condemned the repeated shootings carried out by North Korea in recent weeks, which undermines regional and international peace and security. France once again urged North Korea to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions to engage in a process of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. A French foreign ministry statement said Paris would meet the U.N. Security Council members Wednesday on the issue. • This story originally appeared in Arab News Japan
