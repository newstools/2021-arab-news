CAIRO: Saudi Arabia’s goal to move away from landfills is in line with its larger mission to create a circular economy, which could create 77,000 new jobs and contribute SR120 billion ($40 billion) to the economy. The chief executive officer of Saudi Investment Recycling Co., Ziad Al-Shiha, made the statement on the sidelines of the Green Saudi Initiative in Riyadh. "Saudi Arabia will recycle 95 percent of its landfills during 2035, compared to about the current 5 percent — a complete shift that will have positive effects on the environment and the economy," SIRC CEO said.
