RIYADH: The Royal Saudi Naval Forces and the US Navy have completed a joint naval drill in the Red Sea, the Kingdom’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.
	The 10-day Indigo Defender — 21, which involved the Kingdom’s Western Fleet, concluded on Tuesday in the presence of the exercise’s directors, Brig. Gen. Saad Al-Ahmari and Col. Carl Haywood from the US Navy.
	Al-Ahmari said the maneuvers were designed to strengthen relations and military cooperation between the Saudi and US navies, enhance combat readiness, and to exchange expertise in the field of port protection and the clearing of land and sea mines.
	“It also contributes to developing security capabilities by protecting and securing the seas and regional and international waterways to ensure freedom of maritime navigation in the Red Sea,” he added.
	The exercise included a number of scenarios in which naval units, support boats, landing ships and helicopters carried out practical tasks and tactical maneuvers, during which the participants demonstrated the highest standards of readiness and great skill, Al-Ahmari said.
	He added that this portrayed the RSNF in a way “that reflects the image of development and excellence of our armed forces internationally,” adding that this success reflected the support of the Saudi leadership.
