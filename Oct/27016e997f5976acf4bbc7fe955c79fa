RIYADH: The Arab coalition in Yemen said on Monday it carried out 29 attacks targeting “mechanisms and elements” of the Houthi militia in two districts near the strategic city of Marib in the last 24 hours.
	The coalition said more than 105 Houthi militants have been killed and 13 military vehicles were destroyed in the military operations in Al-Jawba and Al-Kassara.
	The coalition added in a statement that it will continue to provide support to the Yemeni National Army to protect civilians from Houthi violations.
	The coalition has reported heavy strikes around Marib in recent weeks.
	Al-Jawba lies about 50 kilometers south of the city and Al-Kassara is about 30 kilometers northwest.
	The Houthis began a major push to seize Marib in February and have renewed their offensive since September after a lull.(With AFP)
