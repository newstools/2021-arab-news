RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman thanked the leaders of Kuwait and Bahrain for measures taken by their countries in response to comments made by the Lebanese information minister. During separate phone calls with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and Bahrain’s King Hamad, the King said the stances of their countries reflect solidarity with the Kingdom and the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council. A video of Lebanese information minister George Kordahi saying that the Iran-aligned Houthis were defending themselves and calling the war in Yemen “futile” emerged on Tuesday. Kordahi also described the war in Yemen as a Saudi “aggression.” Bahrain gave the Lebanese ambassador to the country 48 hours to leave on Friday after Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Lebanon for consultations, requested the departure of Lebanon's envoy to the Kingdom, and banned Lebanese imports hours earlier. Kuwait followed suit on Saturday and summoned its ambassador to Lebanon for consultations and requested the departure of Lebanon’s charge d’affaires within 48 hours. The king of Bahrain reiterated the depth of relations between his country and the Kingdom and the unity of the GCC countries. Kuwait’s emir said that measures taken by his country affirm the unity of GCC countries and the depth of brotherhood among its peoples.
