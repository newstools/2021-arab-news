CAIRO: No one was unluckier on Tuesday from the thief who stole a reporter’s mobile phone which was being used to livestream a report on an earthquake in Egypt. A reporter for Egyptian news outlet Youm7 was filming live when a man on a motorbike snatched his phone and sped away with it on his bike. Viewers of the broadcast watched the incident as the phone’s camera was left recording, with the camera pointed up toward the thief’s face. Youm7 has shared the Facebook live with the thief's face, saying "tens of thousands" of people were watching live as it was stolen. Police identified and arrested the man on the same day. Now social media platforms in Egypt have started buzzing with humorous commentary on the thief’s misfortune.  #اليوم_السابع
