Egypt will aim to increase the share of renewable energies to over 42 percent by 2035, after the country reached 2022’s target for boosting renewables to 20 percent early this year. The minister of electricity and renewable energy, Mohamed Shaker, noted that Egypt has allocated 7,650 square kilometres of unused lands to new and renewable energy projects, during a meeting with CEO of Lekela Power, Chris Antonopoulos. The minister indicated that Egypt is the largest holder of electrical capacities in the MENA region and has the capacity to produce up to 90 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity, citing Wind Atlas. The meeting was held to support and enhance cooperation between Egypt’s electricity sector and the company, which boasts high expertise in the field of wind energy power plants.
